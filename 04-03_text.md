# Evaluating Customer Satisfaction and Preferences in the Telecommunications Industry: A Comparative Analysis of Survey Data and Online Reviews

## 1. Research topic and background

### 1. (a) Introduction / topic overview

This study investigates customer satisfaction levels and preferences around using artificial intelligence-driven technologies in the telecommunications industry. The rapid advancement in AI has led to tools such as chatbots becoming an integral part of customer service, and while AI-driven technologies can offer personalised and efficient solutions that significantly increase client satisfaction rates, studying the effectiveness and impact of these technologies remains a critical area of investigation.

First, we will survey customers to understand customer service preferences, the adoption of AI-driven tools, and the effect of demographics. We will then analyse relevant online customer complaints to identify trends and opportunities for further improvement.

**❗️NEED TO ADD MORE HERE**: Clear and concise overview of the report,
-  summarising its structure and
-  key findings.

### 1. (b) Background and context

The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted industries, including telecommunications, ranging from finance, healthcare and manufacturing, all potentially disrupted by these technologies (Dwivedi et al., 2021). For example, AI plays an essential role in today’s telecommunications industry, where it can make predictions about decisions, use big data to offer solutions and interact with customers in real-time via conversational agents (Sardjono et al., 2023).

AI-driven technologies such as chatbots, process automation, and automated customer support systems are transforming customer service from human-driven to technology-dominant (Castillo et al., 2021). This transformation offers many advantages, such as improving efficiency, reducing cost and enhancing the customer experience through personalised user interactions. For example, chatbots can handle routing queries and allow their human counterparts to focus on complex, high-value issues. However, as discussed by (Castillo et al., 2021), these technologies can also fail and have negative consequences leading to customer confusion, anger and dissatisfaction, and as mentioned in the introduction, studying the impact and effectiveness of these tools remains critical.

### 1. (c) Motivation and objectives

Objectives:
1.	Evaluate overall satisfaction among customers towards their telecommunication customer service encounters while concurrently identifying the elements behind positive and negative experiences.
2.	Investigate customer perception of AI-based service tools like chatbots and assess their effectiveness in offering efficient and personalised customer service.
3.	Explore the potential correlation between consumer satisfaction and customer service tools that leverage AI technology.
4.	Identify and provide concrete recommendations on how AI tools can enhance satisfaction levels and strengthen market position.

Potential impact:
1.	Improving customer service strategies: By understanding customer preferences and experiences, telecommunications companies can identify areas to focus on where AI-based tools can provide the most significant value.
2.	Boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty: Based on the trends identified in this study, telecommunications companies can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty by enhancing their existing customer service tools.
3.	Encouraging AI-driven customer service tool adoption: This study seeks to understand factors limiting the adoption of AI tools. These findings may help telecommunications companies better promote AI-driven customer service tools, improving customer experiences and reducing workloads for customer service representatives.
4.	Informing industry practices: The output of this study will contribute to a broader understanding of customer satisfaction and preferences in the telecommunications industry. These insights can prove valuable when designing practices to improve customer service.

### 1. (d) Sample and population

The target population for this study is the five major South African telecommunications providers, namely Cell C, MTN, Rain, Telkom, and Vodacom. Ideally, stratified random sampling should be used to get a representative sample from each provider according to their market size. Unfortunately, this will not be possible due to budget and time constraints. Instead, snowball sampling will be employed by asking for respondents on social media platforms and requesting the initial respondents to refer other customers within their social network who might be interested in participating.

Using snowball sampling is likely to result in some selection bias. To minimise the impact, should the data indicate, for example, that respondents are primarily from a single provider, the scope will be narrowed to focus on this provider, reducing the extent to which findings can be generalised.

### 1. (e) Research question(s)

1.	How does customer satisfaction with a telecommunications provider’s customer service differ by the various demographic groups? 

Rationale: According to some studies (Kassim, 2006; Saha* & Joshi, 2019), demographic factors such as age, gender and marital status can have a significant effect on perceptions of performance and satisfaction. 

2.	How do customers perceive the effectiveness and level of personalisation offered by AI-driven customer service tools?

Rationale: AI-driven tools have become increasingly popular in customer service with the promise of reduced labour costs. However, some consumers resist tools like chatbots (Li et al., 2020) and prefer traditional human-based customer service. Therefore, it is essential to understand this aspect and find ways to improve adaptation rates and trust in AI-driven tools.

3.	Is there a relationship between customer satisfaction and using AI-driven customer service tools?

Rationale: Understanding the correlation can help business improve their customer service strategies and ultimately improve customer loyalty and retention (Chen et al., 2021; Ganguli & Roy, 2011).

4.	Based on insights gathered in the survey and comparing it with online complaint behaviour, what are the critical areas for improvement in customer service within the telecommunications industry?

By analysing the trends from the survey data in conjunction with customer complaints from platforms such as Hellopeter (Foulds, 2022), we aim to discover actionable insights that will assist telecommunications in finding key focus areas to improve customer service through AI-driven tools. 

### 1. (f) Domain concepts

The following domain concepts will be considered in this study:

- **Customer satisfaction**: The feelings of pleasure or disappointment a customer derives from the performance of a product or service related to individual expectations (Riak & Bill, 2022).

- **Customer service**: The support and assistance a company provides to those who buy or use its products or services (Meuter et al., 2000). 

- **AI-driven customer service tools**: Technology-enabled service tools, such as chatbots, that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for evaluating real-time service scenarios to provide personalised recommendations, alternatives, and solutions to customer enquiries or problems (Xu et al., 2020).

- **Chatbots**: An AI-driven customer service tool acting as a conversational agent equipped with AI to interact with customers using spoken or written language (Baez et al., 2021).

## 2. Data sources

### 2. (a) Survey data

#### Research questions map to survey questions

| Research question | Survey question(s) |
| --- | :--- |
| How does customer satisfaction with a telecommunications provider’s customer service differ by the various demographic groups? |Q1 - Q5. Which demographic group do you belong to (occupation, gender, age, education and marital status).<br /><br />Q6. Who is your primary telecommunications provider?<br /><br />Q7. How long have you been a customer of your current telecommunications provider?<br /><br />Q8. Are you a prepaid or contract customer?
|How do customers perceive the effectiveness and level of personalisation offered by AI-driven customer service tools?|Q9. Which customer service channel do you prefer when contacting your telecommunications provider?<br /><br />Q11. Have you ever used an AI-powered customer service tool (e.g., virtual assistant) when contacting your telecommunications provider?<br /><br />Q12. If you answered “Yes” to the previous question, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being “very dissatisfied” and 5 being “very satisfied”, how would you rate your experience with AI-powered customer service tools?<br /><br />Q13. In your opinion, do AI-driven customer service tools provide personalised and effective solutions to your queries or issues?|

On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being “very dissatisfied” and 5 being “very satisfied”, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with your provider’s customer service?<br /><br />Q11. Have you ever used an AI-powered customer service tool (e.g., virtual assistant) when contacting your telecommunications provider? (mapped again)|
|Based on insights gathered in the survey and comparing it with online complaint behaviour, what are the critical areas for improvement in customer service within the telecommunications industry?|Q14. Please describe a recent customer service interaction with your telecommunications provider (positive or negative). Include the date (or approximate date) of the interaction.|

#### Operational Definitions

| Concept/Behaviour | Question(s) | Discussion |
| --- | --- | :--- |
|Demographic Data|Q1 – Q5|Only five questions are used for this category to keep the survey short while retaining factors showing the literature to have an effect as it relates to chatbots. This study also aims explicitly to understand if there is a correlation between demographics and customer satisfaction.|
|Customer Segmentation|Q6 – Q8|These specific questions allow us to create further distinct customer groupings, which can be compared and will be important when collecting from our secondary data sources.|
|Customer Preferences|Q9, Q11|In addition to understanding the preferred channel for customer service, these questions also allow us to estimate the adoption rates of AI service tools.|
|Customer Satisfaction|Q10, Q12, Q13|This set of questions allows us to examine overall customer service satisfaction and gauge the contribution made by the AI tools.|
|Opportunities for Improvement|Q14 – Q15|The free-text question helps us understand customer behaviour and pain points to look for opportunities for improvement. This information will also be compared with findings from online customer complaints. By looking at the sentiment of the input, we can also compare how recent interactions might affect customer satisfaction.|

#### Survey structure and question flow

The initial section of our survey comprises a few questions intended to gather basic demographic information from our participants. These questions are relatively simple and require minimal commitment and thus may motivate participation by making respondents feel more comfortable with providing their input. Next, a series of questions are asked about the respondent’s telecommunications provider to set the context for the rest of the survey. These questions are followed by a set of questions that focus on AI-driven service, which is the main topic of the research. Finally, the survey closes with an open-ended question which allows the respondent to provide more detailed and personal insights.

We must remain mindful of three areas where potential bias could be introduced in our final analysis.

1.	**Leading Questions**: Question 13 might be a leading question assuming that AI tools provide personalised and effective solutions. Respondents do, however, have the option to indicate that they strongly disagree with the statement.
2.	**Response Bias**: Question 10 and 12 uses a 5-point scale and might lead to central tendency bias. However, the initial review of online customer complaints showed that customers had strong negative sentiments when their expectations were unmet.
3.	**Recall Bias**: Respondents might not accurately remember all details depending on how recent the interaction was. To minimise this, we ask the customer to specify the approximate date so we can account for it during analysis.

### 2. (b) External data

A related study collected customer reviews for Cell C, MTN, Telkom, and Vodacom from Hellopeter.com (Foulds, 2022). This data will provide valuable insights when used with the data collected via survey. The online customer reviews/complaints will be particularly useful in answering Research Question 4. Through systematic analysis, we can meet Objective 4: Identify and provide concrete recommendations on how AI tools can enhance satisfaction levels and strengthen market position.

The secondary data has a star rating and unstructured text content similar to what is collected in the survey. In the previous study, there were no significant data quality issues. It is worth noting that the reviews are predominately customer complaints. The data is anonymised and publicly available. The ethical evaluation for using this data was already considered when the previous study was submitted to the University of London.

#### Hellpeter Data Collection

Hellopeter data was extracted for the range `Junuary 2021` to `July 2023` via the Hellopeter API, please refer to supplementary notebook `01-01_retrieve_data.ipynb` for the reference code. The data was extracted for the following companies:

- Vodacom
- MTN
- Telkom
- Cell C
- Rain

| Step | Description | Review Count |
| --- | :--- | ---: |
| Initial Retrieval | Retrieve all reviews in the specified range and combine in `01-02_combine_data.ipynb` | 93,880 |
| Filter for Chatbot Reviews | A keyword filter is applied in `01-03_chatbot_reviews.ipynb` to select only reviews that mentions chatbots. | 564 |
| LLM filtering | The OpenAI LLM `gpt-3.5-turbo` is used for further filtering to ensure that the reviews are related to chatbots. (`01-04_chatbot_classify.ipynb` and `01-05_combine_classifications.ipynb`) | 235 |

Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis was done on the final filtered dataset in `01-09_gpt_absa.ipynb` using the `gpt-4` model.

## 3. Data overview and pre-processing

### 3. (a) Data types and pre-processing

#### Survey Data

The survey response is read from an Excel file that was exported from the survey tool. Columns are renamed using the following mapping to make them easier to work with:

| Original Question| Column Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unique Response Number | id |
| 1. What is your occupation? | occupation |
| 2. Which gender do you most strongly identify with? | gender |
| 3. What is your age? | age |
| 4. What is the highest education level you have received? | education |
| 5. What is your marital status? | marital_status |
| 6. Who is your primary telecommunications provider? | provider |
| 7. How long have you been a customer of your current telecommunications provider? | customer_years |
| 8. Are you a prepaid or contract customer? | customer_type |
| 9. Which customer service channel do you prefer when contacting your telecommunications provider? | preferred_channel |
| 10. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "very dissatisfied" and 5 being "very satisfied", how would you rate your overall satisfaction with your provider's customer service? | satisfaction_overall |
|11. Have you ever used an AI-powered customer service tool (e.g. chatbot) when contacting your telecommunications provider?|used_ai|
|12. If you answered "Yes" to the previous question, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "very dissatisfied" and 5 being "very satisfied", how would you rate your experience with AI-powered customer service tools?|satisfaction_ai|
| 13. In your opinion, do AI-driven customer service tools provide personalised and effective solutions to your queries or issues? | effective_ai |
| 15. Please provide your best estimate of the date | review_date |

We now convert the data types to make them easier to work with. The details of each conversion are found in the `SurveyDataTypes` class shown below.

The majority of the data types are converted to `category` with the following columns specifically converted to ordinal values:

- age
- education
- customer_years
- effective_ai

The 'satisfaction_overall' and 'satisfaction_ai' where 1-5 likert scales used in the survey and were mapped using the following descriptive labels:

```python
1: 'Very Dissatisfied',
2: 'Dissatisfied',
3: 'Neutral',
4: 'Satisfied',
5: 'Very Satisfied'
```

The question corresponding to the `used_ai` column was a Yes/No question, and thus converted to boolean.

Finally The `review_date` column was converted to a `datetime` using `%d/%m/%Y` as the custom format string.

ℹ️ **Note**: The `satisfaction_ai` column contains null values for respondents who did not use AI-driven customer service tools.

Here we load the Hellopeter reviews that were filtered for chatbot reviews, map the `business_slug` column from the API to the `provider` column in the survey data, and convert the `review_date` column to a `datetime` using `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` as the custom format string.

Columns from previous experimental classifications are remove and we are left will a tidy dataset containing the following columns:

| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| id | Unique Identification Number |
| created_at | Date of the review |
| review_title | Title of the review |
| review_content | Text of the review |
| provider | Telecommunications provider |

The datatypes are shown below where both the review title and content are string values.

Next we load the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis data for each review. There is a one-to-many mapping between the reviews and the aspects, so at this stage we have tidy data.

In the aspect dataset, an `entity` is a grouping of `aspects`, while the `polarity` column indicate the sentiment of the aspect.

### 3. (b) Data summary statistics

#### Responses and Observations

- The number of responses in the survey dataset: 40
- The number of observations in the Hellopeter review dataset: 235

#### A Summary of the key variables from the survey dataset

##### Gender Distribution

Most of the respondents of the survey were male. It is also interesting to note that none of the respondents chose to `identified as non-binary.

##### Age Distribution

The age distribution of the respondents is shown below. The majority of the respondents were between `25` and `54` years old. This could possibly be explained if we consider that the majority of survey responses came from a LinkedIn.

##### Education Level Distribution

It is significant to note that `82.5%` of respondents have a `Bachelor Degree` or higher.

##### Overall Satisfaction Disribution

`65%` of all respondents report that the are either `Satisfied` or `Very Satisfied` with their telecommunications provider.

##### Telecommunications Provider

The majority of respondents are customers of `Vodacom (50%)` followed by `MTN (25%)`.

##### Satisfaction by Provider

We note that `MTN` has the highest percentage `(30%)` of `Dissatisfied` customers in the survey data.

##### Use of AI Tools

`57.5%` of respondents indicated that they have used an AI-powered customer service tool (e.g. chatbot) when contacting your telecommunications provider. However we should note that `Vodacom` has the strongest AI initiative with `65%` of respondents indicating that they have used an AI-powered customer service tool.

#### Review Sentiment

As mentioned `Vodacom` has the strongest chatbot capability and focus to automate customer service though their chatbot named TOBi. It naturally follows that the majority of the reviews are for `Vodacom`, we will thus focus on this provider when analysing the reviews further.

- As expected, the majority of Hellopeter reviews are negative as indicated by an average sentiment score of `-1.0`.
- `Vodacom` has the most number of reviews discussing a total number of `1,363` aspects.
- Vodacom also have Average Sentiment Score of less than `-1.0` indicating that there are at least some aspects mentioned in either a neutral or positive light.

## 4. Analysis

### 4.1 Individual Variables Visualization

#### 4.1.1 Demographic Overview

Here are the bar charts displaying the distribution of the demographic variables:

1. **Gender Distribution**: We can observe the distribution of respondents by gender. In this survey, there are more male respondents than female.

2. **Age Distribution**: The age distribution shows the number of respondents in each age group. Most respondents in this sample are between the ages of 25-34.

3. **Marital Status Distribution**: This chart provides insight into the marital status of the respondents. The majority are in a 'Married or domestic partnership' status.

4. **Occupation Distribution**: Here, we see the professional background of the respondents. Nearly all respondents in this sample are employed.

5. **Education Distribution**: The education distribution highlights the highest level of education received by the respondents. The sample primarily consists of those with a Bachelor's Degree, followed by those with a Masters Degree or MBA.


#### 4.1.2 Customer Service Overview

1. **Provider Distribution**: In this survey, Vodacom has more respondents compared to other providers.

2. **Customer Years Distribution**: This showcases how long respondents have been customers with their current provider. Most respondents in this sample have been with their provider for more than 5 years.

3. **Customer Type Distribution**: Here, we see whether respondents have a contract, are prepaid, or use some hybrid option. In this sample, most are on a contract.

4. **Preferred Channel Distribution**: This chart displays the preferred channels respondents use to contact their service provider. The majority prefer using the phone, thus preferring traditional customer service over digital channels and self-service tools like chatbots.

5. **Overall Satisfaction Distribution**: This provides an insight into the overall satisfaction levels of the respondents with their provider's customer service. Most respondents in this sample are satisfied with their provided, which logically follows most being long term customers.

#### 4.1.3 AI Tools Overview

1. **Adoption of AI Tools (Pie Chart)**: This chart displays the proportion of respondents who have used AI tools versus those who haven't. In this sample, 57.5% respondents have used AI tools.

2. **Satisfaction with AI Tools (Bar Chart)**: Here, we see the distribution of respondents' satisfaction levels with AI tools. We find that very few respondents who have used AI tools are satisfied with them, and most are neutral or dissatisfied. This is an interesting finding, and indicates that there is room for improvement in this area.

3. **Perception of AI's Effectiveness (Bar Chart)**: We asked all respondents to indicate their perception of the effectiveness of AI tools. Again it is interesting to note that most respondents do not believe AI tools are effective.

### 4.2 Relationships between Variables

#### 4.2.1 Customer Satisfaction by Demographics

These visualizations help us understand how customer satisfaction varies across different demographic groups, addressing the first research question. It is interesting to note that in the sample of respondents, there is little difference in satisfaction levels across different demographic groups.

#### 4.2.2 Perception of AI-driven Tools

1. **Satisfaction with AI vs. Demographics (left column)**: This set of charts shows the distribution of satisfaction levels with AI tools across various demographic groups.

2. **Perception of AI's Effectiveness vs. Demographics (right column)**: Here, we see the distribution of perceptions about the effectiveness of AI tools across different demographic groups.

These visualizations help us address research question 2 and understand how different demographic groups perceive AI-driven tools.

An interesting demographic variable is age. We see that younger respondents (25-34 years) mostly have neutral satisfaction levels with AI, while this same group also mostly believe that AI tools are not effective.

#### 4.2.3 Relationship between Customer Satisfaction and AI

From this chart, we can get a clearer view of the relationship between overall satisfaction and satisfaction with AI tools. The intent is to understand if respondents who are generally satisfied (or dissatisfied) with their provider also have similar feelings about AI tools.

- The x-axis represents the overall satisfaction with the service provider.
- The y-axis represents the average satisfaction level with AI tools for respondents within each overall satisfaction category.

Among the customers who have used AI tools, we do not see a clear relationship between overall satisfaction and satisfaction with AI tools. Interestingly we see that customers who are the most satisfied with their provider are also the most dissatisfied with AI tools.

#### 4.2.3 Key Areas for Improvement

Here's the bar chart showcasing the top 10 areas for improvement based on the most negative reviews:

- The x-axis represents the combination of "Entity" and "Aspect" from the reviews.
- The y-axis indicates the number of negative reviews for each entity-aspect combination.

From this visualization, we can identify areas that received the highest number of negative sentiments, highlighting critical areas that may require improvement.

Since the reviews mentioning chatbots were specifically selected, we can see that the most negative reviews are related to aspects regarding chatbots with the top complaint being the inability to understand the user's query.

Next, we can generate a word cloud based on the review content to visually represent the most common issues mentioned by customers. Larger words in the word cloud indicate higher frequencies of occurrence in the reviews. From this, we can quickly identify and prioritize recurring issues or concerns mentioned by the customers.

Combined with the earlier bar chart, this word cloud offers a comprehensive view of the key areas of concern and potential improvements, addressing research question 4.

### 4.3 Additional Insights

#### 4.3.1 Time Series Analysis

This chart shows how the entities mentioned in Vodacom reviews have changed over time. Polarity is depicted by the colour of the circle, while the size of the circle indicates the number of mentions.

- Entities are generally mentioned in a negative light.
- Between September 2021 and July 2022, there have been more positive reviews mentioning Chatbots and Customer service.
- We notice a correlation between the number of reviews mentioning Chatbots and Customer service.
