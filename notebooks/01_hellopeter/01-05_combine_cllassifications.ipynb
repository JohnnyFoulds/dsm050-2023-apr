On the 14th I called customer service but was referred to TOBI the BOT, of which it was hard for TOBI to understand because he is an Automated Machine, I then asked to speak to a human, with no success. Sent an email to customer care, got a reference but no call back. I went to Sandton branch, but they could not help me because I bought the data online via capitec app. Can we please speak to humans, its really tiring not being able to express yourself.

An advance of R140 against my numbers was taken and transferred along with my airtime by the criminals to their numbers and vodacom promised to cancel the advance and a reference number was issued for my case, 7 days down the line I'm still owing the R140 advance nothing has been done to atleast cancel the advance, when i call their consultants they say i must wait 7 working days for feedback. I can't even access mobile banking because i dont have airtime and i can't  make fonecalls ,the least i expected vodacom to do was to expedite the advance <br />cancellation since it is their fault that this stupid TOBI technology is so weak that criminals are now able to manipulate it to do sim swaps, but no im told to wait 7 working days for feedback. I am not going to buy back that advance from my own pocket for their fault, never.

I explained that I work abroad and would need international roaming to be active to receive OTP's from my SA bank accounts. The consultant advised me this was easy to setup and reassured me that I can have international roaming on a Vodacom PAYG SIM card. I stressed to her the importance of needing this to work properly as I depended on it for conducting business back in SA while working abroad. After again being reassured by her that this would not be a problem, I purchased a new phone and SIM card, on a 'Power bonus' PAYG package. I followed her advice and activated international roaming by calling 082 135 and then using the Tobi SMS bot. I then rechecked before departure and again received SMS notification that Vodafone world roaming was indeed active. I have subsequently switched and updated all my banking and investment contact details to my new Vodacom number however, upon my arrival in the UK, I am unable to connect to any mobile network here. If I search manually, networks of the Vodacom roaming partners are available but all show 'forbidden' and prevent me from connecting. I cannot receive any calls or smses to my new Vodacom number. I have restarted my phone numerous times without. If I go on the Vodacom app it says I am ineligible for roaming but if I contact 'Tobi' via WhatsApp (using WiFi) it says that I am already setup for roaming with Vodafone World.

After many! attempts for nearly 2 weeks to actually speak with someone on a call or email, their system just keeps pushing you into loops with their stupid \"Tobi\" robot that does not even have the intelligence to recognize your question. The package was delivered Thursday 10 Nov. But it was the wrong product. The SIM did not work in my mobile router as ordered. <br /><br />I could not get any answer from Vodacom via phone, email or Whatsapp system. Email auto reply says this channel is discontinued and to contact \"Tobi\" by phone or Whatsapp. On phone & Whatsapp, \"Tobi\" is programmed to tell you to email them. I even tried Twitter but those people could not even read simple English as they failed to answer to my actual question. Immediately Monday 14 Nov (3 days after SIM activation), I went in to their shop and there I was put in phone contact with an actual person. To fix the problem of the wrong product, they had to cancel the contract and collect the delivered product. <br /><br />I had to contact Vodacom again on 17 + 23 + 28 Nov because both the contract calcellation or the product collection has not been done yet. So the product was finally collected 30 Nov. <br /><br />But on 8 December I phoned Vodacom again to find out why I have not yet received the contract cancellation notice via email as I was told repeatedly. I only goy a voice recording that said \"Our call center detects a high number of calls from your number. Your number is blocked to protect the system from fraudulant activity. You have to call ********** / ********** @ R2.00/minute for further help.” SERIOUSLY!!! blocked for fraudulant activity!? <br /><br />On 9 Dec I called the same Vodacom Billing Support numbers using family members phone. After speaking with someone I spoke with on 17 Nov, she put me through to the \"cancellation dept\". There I was put through to someone else again. After having to explain EVERYTHING AGAIN and a very long conversation, this guy confirmed his job was just to GET ME TO BUY ANOTHER CONTRACT! He was not able to cancel the contract but he said \"did send an email to the \"cancellation dept\". <br /><br />At the shop they say they can not help me and I have to speak with those people on the phone.

Their stupid robot changed the order I made for my wife's phone the next morning, adding a whopping R120 to the monthly bill for exactly the same thing. We thought this was erroneous, so we ignored the SMS. We did not confirm it, but they shipped the order anyway. Then they shipped it to the wrong address.

Upon phoning the after-sales number we got from a Vodacom shop employee, they told me she could change the delivery address over the phone, so I relayed this to my wife and told her to phone them. Then they told her that they can't.

       "| 2021-03-11 12:08:12              | vodacom              | Vodacom Customer Care | After listening to the automated menu on your customer care line far too many times and trying to wait it out for the consultant on nearly every menu option mostly unrelated to the issue I wanted to solve, I FINALLY managed to get through to a consultant who was very helpful. I can't even remember during which part of the menu I was finally offered the option to hold for a consultant because your customer care line keeps trying to divert to your \"self-help\" bot \"Tobi\".<br /><br />Suggestions from a customer if you do not want to lose customers in future:<br /><br />1. If you want people to use the bot, that's all good and well, but make sure it at least works before you place it in your call menu. <br /><br />2. After going through nearly your entire call menu to get to a consultant, I can at least let you know, your \"Tobi\" bot only \"works\" on SMS, not WhatsApp. Even if you select the WhatsApp option. I can also tell you, typing \"menu\" as instructed after the bot texts, does not work. Typing ANY word relating to possible Vodacom issues such as \"account\", \"billing\", \"cancellations\" (I can go on), does not work. An annoying message just pops up saying the bot cannot help me with this, please dial 082 135. The sad reality is that customer care number sent me to the bot more times than I can count. <br /><br />3. Another area that needs fixing is getting into my account online. Once I have a set fee for a year or more, I don't go into my account online. Therefore I can never seem to remember the password I use the random time a couple years ago that I wanted to check when my contract is due for an upgrade. If I click \"forgot password\", it sends me an OTP. Which is all good and well, that works. However, when they send a new password for you to use, even after 1 min, 1 hour, 1 day. It will never work. So I cannot get into MY Vodacom account, FORCING me to phone customer care, which is pretty much FORCING me to use the broken bot.<br /><br />4. After finally reaching a very helpful consultant which is all I was looking for in the first place and they asked me to rate their service, you give an option to give them a 10 for very satisfactory. However, every time I typed 10, it said I gave the consultant a 1, and asked if I meant to give them a 1. Why ask to rate a 10 if a person can't give a 10 rating? Why not just make 9 the highest rating?<br /><br />I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I had to spend at least 2 hours of my time trying to get into my account online and phoning customer care to speak to a consultant to finally fix such a small issue. Fortunately for you, I'm quite patient, but I'm definitely not happy with having to try so many different avenues which is what took up my time. I can tell you now, there are many customers out there that would never have put up with this. The punchline, I just wanted to find out why my account was so high last month because for some reason I didn't receive an invoice for last month when I moved from a normal cell phone contract to only a data contract.  <br /><br />On a positive note, while I was trying to access a consultant, I eventually had an idea to contact you on FB messenger. I received a reply within 5 minutes. Unfortunately, it came through just after a consultant answered the phone and helped me. I wish I had thought of taking that route first as I could have had 2 hours of my life to do something more useful and I wouldn't have written this poor review.<br /><br />By the way, I would have given you a rating of 1 but seeing as your actual consultants are polite and willing to help I raised it to 2.              | Customer care chatbot              | The customer complained about the chatbot diverting their call and not being helpful.              | Improve the functionality of the chatbot and ensure it is compatible with all communication channels.              | Vodacom Customer Care              | The customer had difficulty reaching a consultant and faced issues with the chatbot and online account access.              | Fix the issues with the call menu, chatbot, and online account access to provide better customer service.              |\n",
