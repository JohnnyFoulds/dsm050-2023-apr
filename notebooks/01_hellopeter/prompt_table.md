Since then I have been tossed back and forth between Tobi (AI robot) and the customercare email                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 219 | Cant even call to customer service and speak to a human about a problem that isnt listed.               | Good day <br />I want to know who have decided to remove why isn't there option to choose to speak to a consultant when you dail 135. I want that person to dail 135 and have a problem that isn't part of the once that are given to you neither when you chat to robot. I know nowadays its better to save money and have less stuff but the quality of service is poor. I'm a human and I have 2 contracts with vodacom left and the if this is the type of company that you guys have become that cares about profits then quality service then I dont see myself doing business with you ever again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I have tried all their prompts. but I either end up being sent to a  "robot" called Tobi who isnt very helpful or the voice prompt tells me that my Vodacom number does not exist. How on earth can my number not exist ??

The unlock summer rewards is a joke and i am considering using a different service provider because of my experience and the way it was handled when i calked the customer care ( another joke...customer care with a robot tobi) this is the 2nd year in a row that i am having a bad experience because of a reward programme vodacom is offering their customers....laft year i won an online FREE course and to get my account being debited by the company vodacom partnered with. Today i went to purchase a reward i received from vodacom at hungry lion, only to find the code does not work and the staff at the store confirming that customers are coming there and experiencing the same i experienced...error when xode was entered.  I called the customer care line with so many voice prompts i eventually selected customer care for special customers. When i explained to the consutant what my dilemma was....he kept on repeating that i must never ever call that number again...very unprofessional to tell this to a customare....vodacom i just lost all faith in you guys...goodbye                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I am trying to assist an old gentleman with his vodamail password but even after reseeting it it does not work and vodacom support has been no help at all, as I can not ecen speak to someone, tried to phone upgeades and funny enough they answer and if I ask them to put me through to support they say I must just press option 2, as I told them option 2 is for sim swap, they can not help me. I will also not be upgrading my phone at Vodacom this August and also from August not buy any data from vodacom anymore, if you can't help someone with a simple issue like a email password that is not working why should I support you? Anyway vodacom services has went down the drain since all your pricws droppes since the court case you have. Would rather spend more money somewhere else for a better service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So far the debit order has not been done by Vodacom.Trying to get hold of a human being in the accounts department is impossible.Trying to speak to an operator is impossible.I have tried every number on their site.The Bots and useless voice message promting you to enter cell numbers,ID numbers,to say something after the beep etc is the WORST waste of time ever and calls get cut.<br />Could Vodacom please just have an actual operator answer your call when you phone.These recorded options and that stupid useless Tobi Bot is beyond frustrating and of no use.I want to pay my account,but Vodavon doesn't seem to want my money as I can't get hold of someone in accounts no matter what.Please please please please can someone from Vodacom accounts phone me.I can't believe thst you have to go through all that recording **** to get help.Please get rid of it and have an actual operator assist you.I am waiting fir your call.Otherwise Vodacom must never ask me to settle an amount because they clearly don't want the money or new bussiness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

I already have these! I need a 1 document summary for SARS. Mweb and Cool Ideas gave me this after 1 email. <br />Unbelievable...the poor agent said that she could only give me what the Bot Tobi could provide!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 271 | Vodacom cut off my sim                                                                                  | Vodacom decided to discontinue my simcard and give away my number while I was stuck overseas due to pandemic issues. I have had this number for 21 years and it is also my business contact number. ALL my contacts are on the sim, which I cannot access. How dare this happen without notification? I have tried to call vodqcom customer services, who couldn't assist and referred me to the useless Tobi bot. How do I discuss this with a robot? I want an investigation and my number back. This has cost my business severe losses. The number is **********.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 450 | Thieves!!!!!!!                                                                                          | IMPOSSIBLE TO CANCEL THE CONTRACT! They are thieves and continue taking my money months after I cancel my contract! My contract was due to expire end of December 2022, and I moved to Namibia in November 2022, so I stopped my contract at the end of October 2022 and paid the penalty for prematurely stopping the contract. I spoke with numerous agents and sent all the documentation to the cancellations department, where I got a response from the BOT saying that my early cancellation had been received. The problem is now, even after stopping the contract and paying the penalty, Vodacom is still taking money off my account. They took money, Nov, Dec and now JANUARY as well, which means that they - without my approval continued the contract!!! This company is a scam and has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! I need this matter resolved as soon as possible, and I would like the money taken from my account to be paid back!!!!!!! I am staying in Namibia now, and I can't get in contact with a real person other than a BOT. Please contact me via email to resolve this matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 213 | Vodacon diaries - consumer company that hates consumers                                                 | I believe consumer focused companies should never be measured by their ability to sell you new products but rather by how they stand by and support you when their services let you down. <br /><br />Vodacom is one of those consumer companies that is only to happy to take your money for the average service they deliver, but completely abandons you when you most need them when their own service, systems and people fail you. <br /><br />Vodacom is not a brand to be trusted or relied on, they will consistently fail you and charge you handsomely for the priviledge.<br /><br />While I was traveling out the country some random individual did a sim swap and a substantial upgrade on mobile phone account all via a call center. This resulted in a number of other attempts to access other relationships I hold by the parties who conducted the fraudulent upgrades. Sim swaps and fraudulent upgrades occur, that I understand does happen. However when you paint your company as a technology company that is nothing without humanity, you then cannot remove humanity from your organisation and leave your customers to fend entirely for themselves.<br /><br />There is a not a human employee of Vodacom that you can talk to find out why your account is blocked, how a fraudulent transaction was carried out and when your services will be reconnected as everything channels through Tobi the chatbot who is able to sell you more airtime or upgrade a phone but fraud ... no can do.<br /><br />All staff in the stores are franchise staff, who face the same challenges as the consumer, so again no easy fix and they are largely helpless unless you need airtime or an upgrade. <br /><br />Speaking of upgrades, short of providing a DNA swap I get asked for all kinds of supporting documents when upgrading mobile phones in pursuit of RICA, FICA and other regulatory requirements. So my only conclusion is that there is some form of syndicate operating within Vodacom to enable this activity without the same level of due diligence taking place. <br /><br />My question to Vodacom is why focus so much getting customers into you ecosystem if you have no plans to support them once they are in it. I have been a customer for 20 years (not loyal, just easier not to change to another provider that is as bad as yourselves) and have grown to dislike the company intensely - not because I feel I am overcharged (although I am) or because I constantly drop calls (which I do) but because when I need assistance to resolve issues there is no one to assist adequately or timeously. <br /><br />Be better                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 530 | VODACOM AVOIDS CONSUMER QUERIES BY USING ROBOTS TO ANSWER CALLS...                                      | Vodacom is unbelievably unavailable when customers have queries. These bots that answer their phones are just a barrier that they are creating to rip people off. I'm trying to get an itemized bill for my vodacom account because they are billing me almost twice the amount that I signed up for. So yes I paid but I sent an email with clarity seeking questions more than a week ago, to date they have not rep****. I'm trying to call their customer care line and it's only bots that answer the phone and there's just no call centre agent available because their lines are just "too busy" according to these bots .. Really??? Its laughable. <br /><br />What is it with these network businesses? Its not the first time i experience this, i moved to vodacom thinking that I'd get better service and I'm grossly disappointed, when you're billed more than you signed  up for  there must at least be an explanation. In the absence of an explanation, it is THEFT. You sell a package that the consumer is comfortable to pay then suddenly you bill them for twice this amount, when they seek an explanation you are simply nowhere to be found. When Vodacom sells you products, they don't send bots to talk to you but when a client wants to query a bill, they have bots on the line. This is unacceptable. If this persists, we will have to establish an online campaign against vodacom on all social media platforms. Consumers cannot continue to be ********** like this! It's not right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 430 | Why ask number if you have no intention of helping?                                                     | I have contacted Vodacom on Messenger in trying to get my number they deleted back. I commented on FB regarding their use of a bot and suddenly, after 5 days, they communicate again on Messenger. After a while asking my number - i give my number, thinking they want to check that i am who i am, and i got feeling to assist me. Then realised i have the nr i am using, they want my deleted nr. I gave that. Hour's after silence they say they still won't help. Why did they then want the number?

And this useless robot thing on your app for queries, save costs but not at our displeasure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They just say " high call volumes", and put you through to their stupid chatbot that is useless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

I have canceled my cell phone  contract with Vodacom, payed for the remainder of the months and to my surprise two months down the line my credit report reflect Vodacom and apparently I'm in arrears... reading the comments that have been placed by other consumers made me understand that I'm not the only one experiencing this.. how incompetent can a company be, and all these automated responses you guys provide are not comforting one bit..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I however immediately entered into a payment arrangement via their TOBI bot on Whatsapp (screenshots will confirm same). Today I was service blocked despite such payment arrangement because to no surprise the payment arrangement through the bot does not reflect on their system. What is the use of the bot or the payment arrangement then? The 2nd time in as many weeks that I had absolutely horrific service from vodacom and I am seriously contemplating terminating my relationship with them!

I have logged a case with both @VodacomSA and @TymebankZA, it almost a month now, and none of them are taking my case serious, I have to do follow ups with them, they always promise to get back to me before end of business day and those promises are not fulfilled thus far. I have answered all the questions they asked 😭😭😭. I have been using this number since 2009. I am very frustrated, and this is affecting my work, very angry it is affecting my life, my family, I am very very disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 293 | Vodacom Apple Watch Cellular service not working                                                        | The apple watch cellular saga continues with Vodacom. If you are thinking on using them...DON'T! I purchased an Apple Watch cellular last year and what an absolute nightmare it was getting it activated with Vodacom. This year, my watch was replaced and I activated the cellular service again through the Watch app on the iPhone. Everything appeared to be in working order. I was charged for the activation and have been paying a monthly fee for the OneNumber service. Unfortunately, the service has mysteriously stopped working. I have tried emailing Vodacom - no reply. Then I tried the Tobi chatbot - useless. Then I spoke to a consultant - equally as clueless. She kept telling me to activate the service that is already activated!  I am still being charged for a service that does not work. The iPhone Watch app shows the Vodacom plan as "not in use". The watch, when tapping the icon to activate mobile data, shows a black screen. Turning everything on and off DOES NOT WORK VODACOM. Nobody seems to know what the hell is happening. I delayed upgrading with Vodacom for years but eventually succumbed and boy do I regret it. I cannot seem to get any competent assistance with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 221 | Vodacom                                                                                                 | I received an sms stating  "Your WIG for 4UP has been activated."  I have not subscribed to anything at all,  So I am not sure what this is.  It is useless to contact Vodacom via their phone app or chatbot.  The one does not answer, the other does not understand.  So here I am with something that is probably going to cost me an arm and a leg and no way to contact Vodacom, except drive the 50 km's to the Vodashop and back.  Why do we then have an app???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This time I cancel and change to a network that has people helping customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I have been on the phone for over 30mins trying  different options, in hope that I will get an option to speak to a real human being, not this Tobi robot. Tobi can be very frustrated, he does not have all the options I want. Just to cancel an online application has taken me over 30mins. This is not right! we need the agent option still on the voice prompt.

Tobi the Robot cannot help you you have to chat to an consultant and I did.... I give my mail address, phone number and they ask you what you bought last and how much money you still have on there...I cannot remember what amount data I last bought or if I have R2 or R6 on the app.I also do not know if I am kn Lite, essential or pro package besuase I really did not think that any that ever matters....I did this like 3 times and they cannot help me because I am an crok trying to lock in to my own account. A lady even phone me and after a while said she count he'll me if I di not remember if I am on Lite, essential or pro....<br /><br />So be very carefully if this hapoens to you, they ask you yall this to reset and if you cannot remember and you have alot of money on your app, you can kiss it Tata kobaai maraai... you will not go on and you will not see you your money again.... be careful lucky I dot not have alit on there....<br /><br /><br />Vefg bad service if you you cannot remember and standing with your phone in your hand znd they do not even to OP by sms or email... I mean it is still me... no I will not recommend it to anyone one.....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Then I tried the chat bot TOBi but it wouldn't allow you to type. Then I got through to a consultant but I already placed an upgrade order for the Samsung Galaxy S21 Grey only to get an SMS to say there is no stock of the device, the consultant said they only have the violet colour. I was going to give my dad my S10e for his birthday but now I have to wait after his birthday because the new stock is allegedly available only on his birthday, MTN has better deals and they have stock of the grey S21.

I cant get through to a agent because when i try chat on WhatsApp, it keeps telling me that i am apparently not a customer. When i try call the call support number from my other sim card, there is not option to speak to a agent. I cant go through the Vodacom app either because apparently I am not a customer either!!! What is the point of having all these ways to communicate if i cant get help!!!

| 482 | Sim Swap Fraud                                                                                          | I have recieved a sim swap notification on my number yesterday. I imediatly phoned Vodacom customer care and strugled to a point where I eventually got connected to a Agent....well I think it was an Agent. She strugled to understand plain English but I got through to her and she said she reversed the the sim swap and flaged my number for future sim swaps. Then the BOMB. the sim swap went through!!!!!! How the hell did that happen????? I used my daughters phone to phone customer care again as soon as I realized that the network was not down its my number that's not working. Now this is where things get weird. I had the best experience with the Agent that help me this time.....I think his name was Kabelo. He spoke A grade english and helped me with ease. He checked my number but could find no evidence of me phoning in that afternoon( How the hell is that possible?) He assisted in giving me relevant information and reversed the sim swap at the speed of light. Very satisfying service from him. He also flagged my number so that no sim swaps could be done without ID verification. Now I wonder and red flags are flaring up in my head.....This had to be a inside job from vodacom. 1. The sim swap was done using the useless TOBI BOT.<br />2. All the security questions was verrified.<br />3. After reverising the sim swap the first time it was set to still go through.<br />4. No records of me phoning in the first time to do the reversal.<br />5. My bank acount was emptied in the time my number was off and I hold Vodacom pesonnally responsible for this.<br /><br />I remember when I was working for vodacom the Security was very strict on sim swaps. How did Vodacom sink so low as to let a robot do a sim swap?<br /><br />Vodacom realy has to revise their sim swap procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 365 | Unsatisfied Loyal Customer                                                                              | Good day,<br /><br />I have a problem, which I believe should not be a problem - You went to my personal banking account for the monthly debit order, and there was no money on the account, though there was no money on the account however I managed to make the payment via EFT for the outstanding balance, and right now I have been receiving calls from a BOT which is threatening to suspend my line if I don't pay R100,88 - VODACOM LAST I CHECKED, I HAVE MULTIPLE WAYS OF MAKING MY MONTHLY PAYMENTS WHICH INCLUDE EFT, DEBIT ORDER ETC, and my contract is up to date with the payments, can someone explain to me why I'm now receiving calls from BOT stating that my account is in arrears? can someone explain to me when did I agree with VODACOM that they can charge me R100,88 if there's no money in my banking account? MY ACCOUNT IS UP TO DATE I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING - except the monthly instalment of August 2022. Again I will not have money on the 22 August 2022, however I will make a payment via EFT does this mean that you will charge me R100,88 say that my account is in arrears?<br /><br />Which product am I paying for that I took with Vodacom for R100,88 or are you just  exploiting your customers for more money and justify it by saying that we didn't find money into your account on the debit order date.<br /><br />Please update my account with the correct balances - I don't owe you that money. Let's practice fair business - I made the payment, whether it's via EFT or debit order - payment was made.<br /><br />One more thing the BOT is very annoying, it calls all lines you have with VODACOM simultaneously and from my side that's harassment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 326 | PATHETIC SERVICE FROM VODACOM 4U AND YOUR FB ONLINE                                                     | Hi there. I am very annoyed. I applied at your vodacom 4u Berea east london branch for a double up iPhone. Thr lady said they don't have stock of the phone but can put through 2 new additional lines on my current package. Long story short for some reason she said only 1 approved. I told her that I'm disappointed with vodacom for only approving 1 but I will then do the double up online. I told them to cancel the approval I'll do the double up online. I am now blocked doing it online as they have an approval and decline they need to uplift so I can do the online order on the double up. I have been a conract customer since 2007 and this has been by far the worse service I have received. <br /><br />Since this morning the branch is just ignoring me and my request to cancel. I am speaking to someone on your fb messagnger who seems to be a robot! I also see vodacom did 4 credit checks on me yesterday without my permission. <br /><br />I will be taking this further. I also want to know who I can contact to cancel my 5 packages I have and what needs to be paid so I may move to another network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I had it on my last rant, and I'm sure I'll get it here. Some very important people at Vodacom made an executive decision that my problem had been resolved, and that despite the promises made, I didn't need to be contacted. Hello Peter I'm sure, would not tolerate 4 letter words !<br /><br />There are more pillars and posts to be shoved around at Vodacom, than the Parthenon. fewer tour guides . <br />The general view is, that moving this person on to someone else, the problem will go away. Buried in an endless loop of incompetence and dropped calls. Good luck if you try call again. Start all over. Online help with that stupid Bot ? ha ha ha ...<br />Send a mail to customer service....the automated response? Please note: <br />This is a system-generated email that requires your response in order to be processed. After that, a Customer Care agent will contact you within 24 hours.<br /><br />Protecting your Vodacom account from fraud is important to us, so before we can help you with your query, we need to verify that you are the owner of this account.<br /><br />Please reply to this email with these three bits of personal information:<br /><br />ID number or Company Registration Number for corporate accounts<br />Bank name and account type<br />Your Vodacom account number<br />Have you collectively taken leave of your senses !! you want to make sure I am who I say I am, from an email address on your system, and you want me to send my personal details to an automated mail address that could well be fraudulent ?? and thats for the privilege of having my query addressed. Go F yourselves! <br />I have been at the sharp end of some of our pretty dodgy SOE departments, but you guys are seriously leading that competition - by a long shot !!<br /><br />Now - what is your complaint you may ask. Its not going to get resolved in this public platform, so I'm not going to air it here, save to say that complaint number 1 is the impossible task of finding some one that gives enough of an F to take responsibility, and solve the problem !! I cannot waste more hours ( I have called numerous times, mailed, chatted to the robot, been into a store) and I still sit feeling like my service provider ( there's a laugh) really doesn't give a continental stuff !! - and so I resort to Hello Peter.<br /><br />Surprise me Vodacom, if its within you.

The sim swap was done without any notification being sent and a Vodacom outlet was visited before any bank fraudulent activities happened but the outlet performed a sim swap into a wrong number which made it difficult to detect the fraud in time.<br />Currently, there is no way of contacting the Vodacom call centre. 135 is useless and their AI chatbot Tobi is also useless.<br /><br />Can someone from Vodacom call me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Was transferred so that I can get the block removed  now I must wait 2 hours and try again. I have been with Vodacom for over 25 years. I think it is time to change my service provider.  There was a ad on FB advertising upgrades I thought the questions and answers were vague only to find out I was communicating with a robot. How is it possible for a company the size of vodacom to survive giving such bad service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 276 | Tobi the Bot to be replaced like the directors of Vodacom by Baboons                                    | I have come to my ends with companies that think they are clever using chat bots. They are by far the most irritating part about moving into the future. And ehere it starts for mebis vodacom. Tobi is a C@#t. I am sorry to say i ewill be leaving Vodacom just because of him. I dont want to speak to a machine. And i can not get through to a human. And Vodacom are stealing from me and they hope because i dont speak to a  human my problem goes away and i just leave it. Well sorry for them i will post a fantastic review like this for the rest of my life telling everyone how kak they are. <br />Hell man i am a programmer , i will right a multiplying bot that will post on the internet where ever it can how kak they are.  I will do this g i am not contacted and my data and airtime is not replaced within one hour. The board of directors are all monkeys and they should go back to the zoo. And we should get the baboons there to come run vodacom. They will definitely do a better job and that will save more than 1000 call centre staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 284 | If you're not always in SA and near a shop, run far and run fast                                        | Trying to buy airtime.  Both the site and app claim to offer this option, but both just report "a technical problem".  The site and app claim to offer online chat.  On the site this just leads to a page with a submit button that doesn't work (the dev console reports that the site won't accept the call from its own button). On the app it just leads to the eternally pointless chatbot. I'll never understand why businesses don't wait until someone creates a chatbot that is actually useful before starting to use them.  Unfortunately the only other way Vodacom offers for contacting them is by phone.  That's all very well when in South Africa, but not every customer is in SA all the time.  So they've now blocked any customer who needs support outside of SA from getting any.  Unless they can afford the cost of an international call, of course.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a company that pretends to offer features and sees to it that contacting them ranges from difficult to impossible, look no further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

I called Vodacom Westgate to findout how it works and I was told I need to contact customer service or come to the shop if it fails. I called 082135 but couldn't get to speak to the consultant to get assistance. Everything was a bot that couldn't understand my needs. I then went to the shop where a gentleman tried to help me. He got the QR printed and everything done but nothing worked. I paid and everything then his colleague came and said I must leave everything will work after 4 hours. It is now more than 12 hours and I'm still getting errors when I scan the QR code. I'm employed and I can't return to the shop cos they also do not seem to understand this process. Can't call Vodacom cos I will be directed to the bot hence I came here for help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

When I went to my next Vodacom branch at De Ville Centre in Durbanville Central on February 22 at 11.15 the shop assistant was rude and quarrelsome. After some arguing I got him to delete the welcome tone. For my claim to be refunded I was given the Vodacom Customer Care telephone number. On that number I did not find any option for complaints and was talking to their chat bot only.  I still do not know how to get to them for my claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 404 | Vodacom blacklisted me without cause                                                                    | My phone imei was black listed without cause, I was sent from Vodafone to Samsung and back to Vodafone again. I was the advised that my phone have been blacklisted. Frustrated I stayed calm, followed the instructions, completed the unblacklist form and sent it via email. The phone was blacklisted on Friday 14 Oct 2022, it is now a week later and still nothing, no reply on the numerous emails and the tobi bot is a absolute joke. Needless to say I am highly irritated as I had to leave my phone off for 48 hours, then another 48 hours and still ****all happened. I have been a loyal Vodacom customer for many many years. I use my phone for business purposes and can’t have it off for an entire week.

|  95 | Vodacom Vodabucks is a SCAM                                                                             | I ordered a new handset on the Vodabucks Store 2 MONTHS ago, and it still hasn't been delivered!!  I called in a month ago and was told that deliveries are delayed - seriously??  That's nonsense.<br /><br />I don't believe Vodacom even services products from this store.  It's a lie.  I try calling the call centre, and after being redirected through various options, then a stupid chatbot that adds no value other than sending you in circles, I eventually get to the option to be routed to a call centre agent, then as I get dial tone, it cuts me off after 10 minutes of waiting to get through.<br /><br />I spent 2000 Vodabucks for a new handset and no word of it in 2 months.<br /><br />Do NOT use your Vodabucks - it's a scam!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 135 | Vodacom Age of Machine. TOBI is an EPIC Fail!                                                           | It is now impossible to perform a pre-paid sim-swap, vodacom needs to do away with the TOBI bot. It sends too many sms's, sessions are not managed well, it's too early to replace a real human with a bot. Here's a kicker! When You Call 136, option two tells you to call 136. [How do I speak to a person???] There's no USSD String to do a simple sim-swap. No Vodacom shop in rural areas.

Which on its own really sucks.<br />When i go to Vodacom outlet to get new simcard, I'm asked for my ID, proof of address and last 5 numbers i called. How is it that someone managed to do sim swap without having to submit these documents and me as the registered/ FICA person i should struggle. Once i succeed in getting my number back, bye bye vodacom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 396 | Missing Data from Vodacom and useless customer service!!!                                               | I have not received all my data from my monthly contract from vodacom and when i tried to query it i had a very rude consultant that kept having a negative attitude and eventually dropped the call. This customer service agent eventually blocked my number so i cant call vodacom for assistance!!! i have tried everyday since the 1st of October but with no success as i keep getting directed to TOBI the most useless customer servicing BOT that cannot even use its AI to assist with my query... For the past 2 years of being on this contract i have had no issues but now that i do have an issue created by my so called service provider their customer services are pathetic!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 159 | I will be cancelling all my Vodacom contracts when they fall due,                                       | Terrible customer service. It is impossible to speak to a human being - they put you through to some bot named Tobi, make you hold for 20 minutes, and then cut you off. Vodacom clearly has too many customers so they can afford to treat them with miserab;le service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This was not the case, in actual fact I am now going to pay R122.97 more every month. I think it is absolutely scandalous that these people prey on the elderly. I have been a customer with Vodacom for 24 years and I find it quite outrageous to be treated with such disdain.<br /><br />I went to the Vodacom Shop and was told that they could not help, but would send an email to the support team, which was duly done and told me to call various numbers, only to find that my calls were not answered, cut off or told to speak to a Bot named Tobi. I am old school I want person to person contact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

On a sailing trip to Namibia my phone fell overboard.<br /><br />I contacted vodacom as soon as we arrived to arrange for a sim swap. After many hours of talking with support, I was told the only way to do a sim swap was to purchase a new contract sim card and have it couriered to Namibia and then the swap could be done. I did so at great expense.<br /><br />I contacted Vodacom support again to complete the sim swap and I am now being told it is not possible! After all the costs and frustration the support agent refuses to assist and they keep referring me back to Tobi, Vodacoms robot assistant. I am fed up!<br /><br />Surelly I am not the first client to be stuck in a situation like this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 313 | Really bad customer service. Absolutely useless chatbot                                                 | I tried to purchase data via the app last week, twice the transaction failed leaving me unable to buy data. I did not realize at the time that the charges still went off my bank card. <br /><br />There is no way to contact anyone to arrange a refund, just an endless maze of "smart" customer service options that push you toward the chatbot that cannot help with these kinds of queries<br /><br />After 15 mins waiting today I finally got through to a person in the Vodacom Online department. She said she couldn't help and that I needed to speak to customer service department.

| 386 | Pathetic is too generous a word                                                                         | I've just spent more than an hour trying to find a way to cancel a recurring data bundle. The only place Vodacom even MENTIONS it is in one line on their Ts & Cs: "You may activate and deactivate the Recurring Bundles at any time." The word "deactivate" is then never mentioned again. I've tried everything - *135# for USSD self-help, SMS chatbot, WhatsApp chatbot, and even PHONING 135 to get assistance, where just another useless robot gives me NO WAY to get hold of a human and no relevant options to help me. An old post on your Twitter says dial *135*6#, but that is not relevant to cancelling recurring data bundles.

| 289 | Vodacom purposefully avoiding paying clients back through their bot Toby                                | Vodacom will not let you speak to a human lately. Toby (I hate bots) can’t handle complex issues especially when you need help in hurry. It comes across as the company’s way of scamming their clients if you can’t claim back your money for their mess ups. Which happen a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  11 | Chatbot Tobi/ Voice Bundle                                                                              | I am disappointed at how your service has become so limited. The introduction of your chatbot has made it impossible for your customers to inter act with call center agents when facing queries that are not generic in nature.<br /><br />I attempted to buy a voice bundle via your app but it failed to load my bundle but managed successfully debit my account.<br /><br />When trying to get help, your chatbot Tobi will not be able to assist me. It goes as far as sending me my balance which is of no use to me.<br /><br />I need my bundle to be loaded or my money to be reimbursed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
