On the 14th I called customer service but was referred to TOBI the BOT, of which it was hard for TOBI to understand because he is an Automated Machine, I then asked to speak to a human, with no success. Sent an email to customer care, got a reference but no call back. I went to Sandton branch, but they could not help me because I bought the data online via capitec app. Can we please speak to humans, its really tiring not being able to express yourself.

       "| 2023-07-18 21:38:08 | Vodacom | Is it Vodacom? or should it be Vodapong or VodaGo? | I recently moved into an apartment/townhouse in a complex in Morningside in Sandton.  The unit is fibre ready.  All I had to do was to get a router and get connected.  I have had a Vodacom account for many years for my cell phone, so I thought I would go with them.  They are a trusted name in the industry.<br />Round about the 2nd or 3rd of July 2023 I called Vodacom **********.  I spoke to a most obliging, friendly, and helpful consultant.  I was offered a package with Openserve as the fibre provider.  It was what I required, and within my budget.  The router arrived the next day.  I set it up, the wifi was working, but no Internet.  I called the customer service department. It was the first of many, many, many calls,  They told me my application would be activated.  Wonderful, or so I thought.  Nothing happened.  I call again.  \"Mam, it is being attended to.  We will esculate.\" This I heard on several occassions.... Then I was told it is was Openserve who were holding things up.   I contacted Openserve... you cannot speak to person. Commuication is through, initially a Bot and then e-mail.  They advised that Vodacom need to take 'Ownership' of the number.  I duly report back to Vodacom.  I have to say that the consultants are friendly, they have answers to your questions, full of informative advise albeit that the answers are incorrect, and the information is misinformation.  I was offered many reasons for the activation not taking place, \"Your address was incorrectly spelt\" How many ways can you spell Square? Openserve are not in your area.... Then why sell me a package with Openserve? I found out that Openserve are in the area but don't service my complex.  This whole process has now taken two and a half weeks.  Today I was informed by the Body Corporate of my complex to go through Metro Fibre.  I took a deep breath, and contacted Vodacom again.  My question, \"Can Vodacom offer me a package with Metro Fibre?\" This they could do by cancelling the existing order.  Collect the original router, providing me with a new one, and this whole process will take another 7 to 21 working days.... They expected me to wait this time after they had sold me an unworkable package, and being in constant communictation with them for two and a half weeks,.... I think not... On Friday of last week I received a call from a consultant.  She advised that I must cancel my existing application and take out a new one.  I go through the whole sign on process again.  The call ends.  I was about to send her the RICA documents she required when I received a call from the original consultant.. She informed me not to go for the second application as the one she opened is still ongoing and activation is going to take place.  I was told a technician would be coming to my home to to do the activation, another consultant told me it was done remotely. I was even told the name of the technician, and he is the best there is.  When I demanded to speak to a supervisor or a team leader as they are called in Vodacom world, they were always busy.  Today I was told, \"you can hold for him\". They expected me to hold on, for who knows how long, wasting my time and my airtime.  I said to the lady, \"You are the services providers, you get your team leader to call me\".  Obviously, I never received a call.  Today, was the final straw.  When they informed I would have to wait for another 7 - 21 working days.  Yes, for that period I was offered a free LTE service for a month..  Very generous and very nice.  But too little to late.  Sorry Vodacom. but your service here has been deplorable.  As I have stated your customer care consultants are extremely well trained.  Their telephone manner is excellent.  But, please. don't mislead your customers.  Needless to say I cancelled Vodacom, I am waiting for them to collect their router.  Today, I called Rain.  Spoke to a very informative person on the phone, paid the the sum of R1,00 yes, you are reading correctly R1,00 to secure my account.  I went to collect the Rain Box.... Yes, I am now Singing in the Rain.  My devices are connected.  My dealings with Rain, the call, collecting the Rain goodies, and setting it all up, an hour or so.  Please, Vodacom have a little more respect for your customers. |\n",

I called Vodacom Westgate to findout how it works and I was told I need to contact customer service or come to the shop if it fails. I called 082135 but couldn't get to speak to the consultant to get assistance. Everything was a bot that couldn't understand my needs. I then went to the shop where a gentleman tried to help me. He got the QR printed and everything done but nothing worked. I paid and everything then his colleague came and said I must leave everything will work after 4 hours. It is now more than 12 hours and I'm still getting errors when I scan the QR code. I'm employed and I can't return to the shop cos they also do not seem to understand this process. Can't call Vodacom cos I will be directed to the bot hence I came here for help. |\n",
       "| 2023-07-16 14:28:00 | Vodacom | VODACOMS TOBI IS USELESS | Vodacom had decided to go automated and created their Chatbot Tobi.  What a useless piece of technology.  I would like to rather speak to a human and not some computer.  I had a problem with my phone and after going through the whole answer system, instead of getting an agent to help me, I am routed to Tobi.  Again we go through a whole lot of questions.  Then Tobi tell me that he is unable to help me and asks if I would like to speak to an agent.  I confirm with a \"yes\" and Tobi responds with \"you have chosen the self help option\".  Totally not what I have chosen and we start again.  Because choosing to speak to an Agent previously haven't helped, I now chose not to speak to an Agent.  Thinking that maybe Tobi is a bit confused.  So I say \"no\".  To which Tobi replies \"I am unable to help you at this stage.  Goodbye\".  Frustrating to no measure.  Vodacom, if you are going to go the automated route, make sure it actually works. GRRRR!!!!! |\n",
       "| 2023-07-15 13:42:15 | MTN South Africa  | MTN HORRIBLE UNCAPPED DATA ****MING SYSTEMS | I received a call from a telemarketer regarding an uncapped non-contract pay as you go data contract offered by MTN. The lady promised that the promotion was non-biding and not a contract. She further promised that the router to be supp**** is load-shedding proof, meaning that it would not be affected by load-shedding and it is self-reliant. I noted my concerns regarding MTN coverage in our area that is was always poor but she insisted that her system and the router had a strength power to ensure we get the best uninterrupted and uncapped wi-fi signal for our family.<br />I requested her to send me the contract first via my email but she promised that I could cancel the contract any time within 14-days if I am not satisfied. <br />The router was delievered with a sim-card (mtn) and to my amamzement, the router was like any other normal router which had no back-up supply. The router failed  the loadshedding proof.<br />We started to be 5 -days without signal from our router which is normal for MTN coverage in the Zeerust Northwest. <br />In February 2023, I requested MTN to cancel my service because it was the worst service I ever had. I was paying R524-00 monthly by would only have 4 days per week on average coverage. The router provided me with the worst experience, however MTN customer care would only provide me with sweet automated messages as if they really care.<br /><br />I send them a notice of cancellation of the contract because it was not worth it. It was not<br /><br />1) Load shedding proof<br />2) fast 5G as promised<br />3) worth to supply me with uncapped wi-fi without throttling.<br /><br />MTN customer care acknowledged my letter but later reverted back to me that I cannot cancel my contract which was a PAY as You Go. They notified me to pay an early cancellation fee of R2500-00. <br /><br />They are still debiting my account for R542-00 every month since the notification period which is a violation of the contract terms. <br /><br />Calling MTN customer (horrible) care is waiting for 30 minutes on the phone which is not worth it. Sending them emails is writing to an automated ChatBot system that provides horribly scripted responses of sweet messages which never solve any problem. |\n",
       "| 2023-07-11 19:09:24 | Vodacom | HAS VODACOM IMPLEMENTED IT’S OWN FORM OF LOADSHEDDING? | Vodacom's service is beyond disappointing. Over the past 6 days, at the time of writing this message, we’ve had more than 35 hours of no data signal and, since the signal has still not been restored, this number is guaranteed to climb by the hour.<br /><br />Data outages over the past 6 days…<br />Wednesday 5 July 2023: 4:30pm - 11pm<br />Thursday 6 July 2023: 5pm - 7pm<br />Friday 7 July 2023: 5pm - 7pm<br />Saturday 8 July: 9am - 11:30am & 5pm - 7pm<br />Sunday 9 July 2023: 11pm to 11:30pm<br />Monday 10 July: 3pm - 5:13pm & 9:30pm - 9:45pm & 11pm – 12am<br />Tuesday 11 July: 12am – 17:18pm <br />This uncannily resembles Eskom’s loadshedding schedule. There is, however, no connection. None of these outages took place during or at any time close to loadshedding periods. In any case, there’s been very little loadshedding over the past week.<br /><br />Many of these outages appear to be planned. How is it that so many of them commence at exactly the top of the hour and cease at exactly the top or bottom of the hour 2 to 2.5 (or more) hours later?<br /><br />I literally spend hours every month wasting air time on their call centre. Without data, this is the only means of reporting outages, which Vodacom should be tracking anyway. To add insult to injury and without fail, I am forced to deal with the robot called Toby who, at a leisurely pace finds it necessary to repeat the recorded message about the effects of loadshedding. All callers hear this message at the beginning of the call, and once is enough. Toby is never of any help whatsoever and amounts to nothing other than a ridiculous waste of both the caller’s time and air time. The customer however has no choice but to tolerate all of this just to speak to a human consultant.<br /><br />Once getting through to a consultant, I then have to endure the barrage of verification questions before being able to report the outage. Further to that, it’s often difficult to hear the consultant with incessant shrieking and cajoling in the call centre’s background. At times it sounds more like a street party than a call centre. It would behoove Vodacom to invest in soundproofing their consultants’ workspaces and training them in the fundamentals of how to behave in a professional environment.<br /><br />At the beginning of 2023, Vodacom took the liberty of increasing its prices across the board. My hope was that they would invest this money in improving their service. Quite the opposite is true. The user experience on all fronts is appalling for the customer, and I strongly suggest that Vodacom makes the effort to experience firsthand what the average customer needs to tolerate when their only option is to report an outage via the call centre, especially when the same call needs to be made repeatedly, week after week, month after month.<br /><br />Vodacom is uncompromising when it comes to their monthly debits for services, despite failing to deliver. They even have the audacity to insist upon charging a cancellation fee when the customer wishes to terminate the contract because Vodacom has failed to deliver the service for which the customer is paying. It’s time for Vodacom to begin compensating their customers for these kinds of unacceptable outages and to begin to act on actually providing the services that they so boldly proffer when selling a customer a contract.<br /><br />Finally, I posted this complaint on their Facebook wall. Their response? Well, nothing other than simply removing the post and doing nothing further. Public relations is apparently not their forte either. |\n",

People warned me before I got myself into this mess, and said MTN will eventually blacklist me over their incompetence.

       "| 2023-06-08 12:08:47 | Vodacom | as above | On 3 January 2023 I contacted Vodacom Cancellations on ********** to cancel my existing contract due to expire at the end of February 2023. I was informed by the lady who took my call that the last debit order would be at the end of February 2023. On 2 March I noticed that this contract has not been cancelled.  I AGAIN phoned Cancellations and the woman that answered the call was extremely rude telling me that the no. does not belong to me and said to phone the billing department.  I phoned Billing and gave the exact details that I gave to this unmannered woman at cancellations and the lady tried assisting but said I have to contact Cancellations.  Another call (and 1 hour later!!!!!!) I spoke to Mvelo who informed me that the contract was not cancelled instead the lady that I spoke to on 3/1/23 cancelled A CANCELLED CONTRACT OF A YEAR AGO!!!!! How ***********.  Mvelo assured me that the matter will be escalated and I will receive feedback with 48 hours.  Needless to say, NO FEEDBACK!!!!!!! This is totally unacceptable and I WILL NOT be held liable for Vodacom’s incompetency.  Should this matter not be resolved IMMEDIATELY, I will report this to ICASA!  As Vodacom’s robot informs you ALL CALLS ARE BEING RECORDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I suggest you go listen to the recordings AND REVERT BACK IMMEDIATELY.  ICASA will be contacted on 8/3/23!!  ON 8 JUNE 2023 THIS UGLY SNAKE COMES BACK!!! I RECEIVE AN SMS FROM VVM DEBT COLLECTIONS ADVISING THAT THERE IS R538.26 OUTSTANDING ON THIS ACCOUNT.  AFTER ALL OF THE ABOVE AND A CALL FROM A LINE MANAGER ADVISING THAT THE CONTRACT IS CANCELLED AND NO FURTHER COSTS WILL BE DEBITED.  BY THE WAY, THE NO. WAS MIGRAGTED TO PREPAID ON THE SAME DAY.  WHAT UTTER INCOMPETENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VODACOM BETTER SORT THIS MESS OUT BEFORE I AGAIN REPORT THIS TO ICASA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! |\n",

The fact that it was bypassed and Vodacom allowed it makes it *****ulent. We want all airtime taken reversed. When sending query to customer care, we are forced to chat to Tobi the robot instead of human. How can you explain the query to a robot? Is it because this is a prepaid number? Please contact my dad and refund him his airtime used for this content service. I deactivate it on the app again as it was definitely active. |\n",

PLEASE ASSIST | Vodacom can no longer assist me as I have now migrated back to prepaid from a contract. Vodacom just blocked and suspended my number and now I can't make calls all because I asked to go back to prepaid. I have been going to the Vodacom store and calling customer care since last week all to no resolution. The employees at Vodacom keep telling me 5 different things and transferring me to the wrong departments. Your robot Tobi just ends the call and says he can't assist. Do you even train your employees ? Why is everyone at Vodacom failing to assist me ? Do I have to be a celebrity to get some assistance from Vodacom ? All they keep telling me is my contract is upto to date. I have no liabilities but since I am prepaid they can't help me. So now that I'm on prepaid I can't use me Sim and number ?  Really? What's with the horrible service. Can someone just activate my number so that I can get my bank details in order then once all is sorted I will seize to be a vodacom customer since you fail to assist me. |\n",

       "| 2023-06-04 22:00:21 | Vodacom | Vodacom Delete Numbers is a **** to Withdraw Money from your Bank Account | On the 30th of May 2027, Vodacom deleted the cellphone number I have used for the past 6 years and which I actively used daily for all transactions, banking, internet logging, making daily calls, and many more. Although Vodacom offers 99% coverage, their customer service care offers only 1%. Tobia Support offers no alternative to talk to the agent. In my opinion lacks any common sense nor intelleigence. The second customer care line is 082135 which simply is a machine prompt simply like Tobi. It keeps asking you to press 1 or 2 or 3 with no choice to be able to talk to a human being who may seek to understand what really transpired. Vodacom Twitter Support is another Tobia support with no heart or care.  These Vodacom chatbots write some narcissistic sympathetic messages such as \" We are sorry for the inconvenience this might have caused you...\" and with no real sympathy at all. How does a reputable company like Vodacom delete a number which has never been inactive for more than even 24 hours yet these Vodacom support chatbots will send the \"Vodacom Terms and Conditions\" violated by the same company?<br />The night my number was deleted, it's the same night my standard bank account was hacked and R1600 was transferred from my account. My Vodacom number was deleted, yet the same number was activated to authorize transactions from my bank account. And the only help and assistance or support I could get from Vodacom support was to buy a new sim card and register it. |\n",
       "| 2023-06-02 08:21:15 | Vodacom | Vodacom online deals seem to not be available as advertised? | After spending a lot of time considering her options, my wife app**** for an advertised online deal for a Samsung A34 at R349 per month. After initial vetting etc. a Vodacom agent called her and indicated that she 'did not qualify for that deal' but did qualify for a significantly more expensive deal offering more data etc. for this cellphone. When she indicated that she was not interested in the extra data etc. and would like the advertised deal, the agent offered her a cheaper deal for a lower end phone, which she declined.<br /><br />I phone Vodacom to enquire how it is possible that someone do not qualify for a cheaper deal, but do qualify for a more expensive deal the agent indicated that they will only discuss the matter with my wife.<br /><br />Consequently I sent an email to customer care which came back indicating that I should use the TOBI chat bot to contact them. TOBI could obviously not answer my question.<br /><br />We decided to rather opt for another service provider.... |\n",
       "| 2023-05-31 19:52:52 | Vodacom | Vodacom Horrible Customer Care Service-Deleted Active SImcard | Vodacom had a sim card policy to delete a sim card that is inactive for a period of 120 days. On Sunday, 28th of May 2023, Vodacom deleted my sim card which has been active for the past 6 years and was last active on the 27th of May 2023 at 22:00 loaded with airtime and data of R600-00. I contacted Vodacom Tobi Chatbot, it simply gave me an unhelpful answer. I then contacted the Vodacom customer care line, and the answering machine said \"Enter the number you are querying\". After I entered the number, it answered: \"We can't recognize your number\". There was not even an opportunity to talk to an agent. I then contacted Vodacom support on Twitter. The machine on Twitter was as unhelpful as Tobi the Chatbot. The Vodacom support simply said, \"The number has been deleted because inactive sim cards are deleted as per Vodacom policy. Then it sends me the link to the Vodacom terms and conditions website. <br />All the numbers which Vodacom provided were just so unhelpful and left me frustrated because I was spending almost R1000-00 every month on Vodacom services. <br />Tobia CHatbot is a horrible Vodacom support and so is their Twitter Support.<br />I can imagine how many sim cards are erroneously deleted by Vodacom and people who forfeit their data and airtime because of such bad customer support. |\n",
       "| 2023-05-31 17:50:48 | Vodacom | Vodacom Blocked My Sim After I Requested To Go Back To Prepaid After My Contract Ended For No Valid Reason | I ended my vodacom contract and the contract is supposed to end 31 May. This morning I received an sms stating that my sim was now prepaid. After that I bought 60 anynetwork minutes as I had to make an Urgent call only to find my sim is blocked and I cannot make calls anymore. I keep receiving an automated vocemail  message saying my sim is blocked and I should contact my service provider everytime I try to make a call. I cant even call Vodacom customer care (the actual service provider) . I had to get a robot \"Tobi\" to actually help with getting someone from Vodacom to call me. The consultant I spoke to told me I had to go to the Vodacom store to get my sim Rica'd and re registered, after 10 years of Vodacom having my details on file I must still go to Vodacom to rica my sim. Does Vodacom only allow contract sims now. Can we no longer be prepaid clients? Cos I just came from the vodacom store and they told me my number is not on the system where it requires me to rica again and they did a network boost or something like that which another consultant already tried to do. Did I just go to the Vodacom shop for NOTHING!!!?? My sim STILL not working. I STILL cannot make calls. Only because I changed from contract to prepaid. IS vodacom a ****? |\n",
       "| 2023-05-30 11:16:00 | Cell C | Cell C - Refund Struggle | This is going to be a long post. <br /><br />However I need to expose how useless Cell C are with their service. How I continue to struggle to get my money back. <br /><br />I have been fighting with Cell C since the 4th of May to return my money and process a refund. <br />On the 23rd of May , I was at my wits end. I posted on Hello Peter with a complaint. <br />I got a \"Private\" response, so I wanted to post what Cell C has done to assist me, publicly. <br /><br />My original post said the following ( Posted 23rd May 2023) <br /><br />Pathetic service , Theives , Emotionless , Robots , Script readers, Useless , inompetant staff. <br />I have been fighting with Cell C since the 4th of May to return an amount of R1400 that they debited off my account after an EFT payment was already made on their instruction. <br /><br />I have spoken to about 17 different people until today. The sequence of events between then and now is as follows. <br />1. Was told to send proof of payment - no response <br /><br />2. was told to send proof of payment again, - no response<br /><br />3. I was told to email collections. No response <br /><br />4. phoned call centre, and was asked to email proof of payment, I also added in my banking statement so they could see what i was referring to for extra clarity. <br /><br />5. getting desperate now , running low on food money , I call again, and eventually on the May the 15th somebody with a brain cell , raised a refund ticket for me, I was told someone would be in contact with me within 2 days  - no one phoned. <br /><br />6. I followed up the next day , I was told that the refund would be escalated but this process takes 72 hours. <br /><br />7. Friday 19th of May I eventually demanded to speak to a manager , who also was not very helpful, His name is Tshepho , he said the process takes 10 business days, ( not true I looked on their company site and its 7 working days ) he just said he had marked my refund as urgent in a mailbox. yes in a mailbox with 5000 other emails. I have almost no money at this point. I need electricity as I work from home, I need food to feed my kids, I need fuel to get them to school. No one cares. they dont care. <br /><br />8. Monday 22nd May - I phone early in the morning and asked to speak to Tshepho the manager from Friday. I was told he will phone me in ten minutes that was at 8:39am. I phoned the call center back at 11am , who then said they are transferring me to him  but instead I was on hold for 39min  until eventually I dropped the call. I eventually got hold of Tshepho , and all he could say was he can see its in the approval process. Not once has anyone offered to take ownership and keep me updated. <br />I burst into tears begging that he help me , I need to feed my kids. <br />Its almos time for the next debit order run. He doesnt care, he cant go the extra mile, he said he has not contacts in finance to call and ask for assistance. We had bread for supper last night. <br /><br />10. Its Tuesday the 23rd of May , I call again at 10:30am this morning, I ask to speak to Tshepho , I am told he is on lunch, but I must not worry he will phone me back as soon as he gets in. You guessed it , its almost 4pm and no one has called me. I phone back at 3pm this afternoon , I am told that they can see that the refund has been approved, but that does not mean that the money is on its way to my account. Keep in mind today is the 7th working day since I raised the refund ticket. The lady tells me that it takes 7 days after the refund has been approved. <br /><br />I feel defeated. I have no food in my house, both my kids went to school hungry today , I have almost no fuel left in my car , I have 8 units of electricity to last me until I get paid. <br /><br />How is it that you F&*&(&(*&*& C(*&()*&)*(&)(*7 can affect my life like this ? Emotionless. YOU STOLE MY FOOD MONEY TO FEED MY KIDS THIS WEEK. NO BODY CARES THAT YOU HAVE KIDS TO FEED AND TO BE ABLE TO WORK. <br /><br />I AM AT MY WITS END, PLEASE CAN SOMEONE DO SOMETHING. THIS IS REDICULOUS TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS MINE. <br /><br />YOU DID THIS NOT ME . YOU HAVE CRIPPLED ME THIS MONTH YOU STUPID TWITS. <br /><br />CAN SOMEONE IN CELL C WAKE UP AND FIX THIS . YOU CANNOT GET THROUGH TO ANYONE THAT IS ABLE TO ACTUALLY HELP YOU. <br /><br />ITS WORSE THAN GOING THROUGH A DRIVE THROUGH AND ASKING FOR THE LETTUCE TO BE REMOVED, BUT INSTEAD THEY REMOVE ALL THE GARNISH, YOU ARE WORSE !!! <br /><br />HOW ON EARTH MUST I FEED MY KIDS THIS WEEK.<br /><br />Response Cell C : <br />Good day<br /><br />Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused by this.<br /><br />Our records indicate that a refund was prepared today (23/05/2023).<br />The refund takes anytime from 3 to 7 working days to reflect in your account.<br /><br />My reply: <br />Exactly , another 7 days , what the hell . Again, what about the fact that you took it from me on the 4th of May  and I have been fighting for my money back. How must I feed my kids  ?  Another example of a half scripted answer. No one is willing to push this through or try to make a call and escalate , as a result of an internal error , in other words make it right. I am your client after all.  As I said no one gives a f**k right ?  Let me go tell my kids that unfortunately there is still no money. You have caused my kids and myself to go hungry this month because you are idiots, now you just go and put your foot in it and say the same thing I am complaining about. How can you tell me its another F**king 7 days. Do you have children ? <br /><br />Response Cell C: <br />Please receive our apologies for the unpleasant experience received thus far, <br /><br />The refund has been prepared and the funds will reflect within 7 working days.<br /><br />My reply: (Same day 23.05)<br />Please confirm exact date of payment ? Surely you can make a call and confirm , please I beg you <br /><br />Response by Cell C: <br />Unfortunately, we cannot confirm the exact date of payment.<br /><br />30th of May 2023: <br />I have just called Cell C , I was just told that there was nothing they could do for me if the refund has been approved. <br /><br />I educated the agent on the process of escalation. After being put on hold for another 3 minutes, I was told she will escalate for me to the escalations department. <br /><br />Guess what. The escalations department has 72 hours to get back to me. Another 3 days to wait for feedback. Are you kidding me ? <br /><br />4 - 15th of May = 8 days of continously emailing and phoning until eventually being told to log a refund ticket. (Business working days) <br /><br />15 May - 23 May = 7 business workiung days to process a refund <br />23 May - to date  = 6  business working days and counting ......<br /><br />21 Business Working days dealing with Cell C to get my refund sorted. <br /><br />and now you want to tell me another 3 days to have it escalated. |\n",

Don't take up the position of Vodacom directors as you may find yourself in jail, despite the fact that you will out do your predecessor's by far. | Once again Vodacom *****ing from us. I have been in JHB General now for 5 days and will most probably be here for another 21 days. In these five days I have averaged 2 gig a day. Of which I have lost at 30% if not more from downloads that seem to fail not as they start. Not half way , but at the end. . <br />I am not even bothering to try contact Vodacom because I refuse to speak to a robot that doesn't understand and leads you in circles in the hope that you will give up and sweep it under the rug. <br />And guys my last review apologies to the Pretoria zoo ******s for nominating them as the board of directors of Vodacom . Really guys don't take these positions as you may end up in jail for theft as they have been *****ing like in my last review Vodacom is *****ing Billions from us South Africans because for every 1 mb I downloaded 2 mb came off. . <br />Mysteriously the next day it was fixed and my downloads became accurate and now I find they just adopt another method. The thieving *******s are worse than our government. . They should all be jailed together. Now I find my self tonight not being able to complete my downloads due to our friends raking in my data and it's so weird that it happens everyday exactly the same way. I download for example two files of say 150 mb each and the download speed is terrible slow and I keep my phone doing absolutely nothing else so that I don't mess with them . As it's getting to the end 45 minutes later all of a sudden one download fails and dissapears and when I go to the Vodacom app the other one goes. Like tonight I was fortunate to have enough data to download one of the files I started and what would happen when I initiate the download. Zim zalla bim it downloads the entire 150 mb in less than 3 minutes done. But now I can't down load the other file because these *******s have ****** my data. Other nights I was not fortunate to have data to download the files again. <br /><br />And surprise surprise, I always get a email from Hello Peter saying Vodacom has responded and I am still waiting from the first review. <br />Because Vodacom are confounded ****'s. <br />They never get back to me .

Thats what your twitter team advised me. They refused saying they not allowed to sell sim cards to client and not rica them wow okay. the 4th time I went there the lady wanted to turn me away again telling me there was loadshedding earlier on their system is still back. I refused told her I am not buying that cause this was the 4th time. Walla out of no where they could assist me.

I recieve delivery today. Open the device try to switvh it on boom the device says that it wants a password.Just as I switch it on it shows username defaultuser0 and asks for password.

Tried to reach out to your twitter they are just robotic and useless. Am I suppose to call vodacom again and ask for the collection reference number? The service is poor. You honestly do not care.

       "| 2023-03-28 15:15:05 | Vodacom | Good service turning into a nightmare | I phoned Vodacom Friday the 17th of March to cancel my contract as I wanted to port my number to Cell C. The reason for this is that I could get the same contract (that Vodacom charges R2438 per month) at Cell C for R1719 (at Cell C this included 3 000 minutes, 10GB Data, a Samsung S23 Ultra and a Samsung Galaxy 5 Watch). The consultant that was on the phone did not want me to cancel as I've had this contract with Vodacom for more than 20 years already. He asked what the reason for the cancellation was and I told him. He asked me to hold on to see if they can possibly match the deal. I heard him talking in the background (I assume to one of his supervisors), after a while he came back and said they can offer me the Samsung S23 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy 5 Watch, Unlimited minutes and 15GB data for R1878 per month. I reckonded this is a good deal and it will save me the hassle of having to port to another service provider, so I accepted the offer. He then offered to deliver the phone and the watch, but I am not at home / at the office a lot, and giving someone else a certified copy of my ID to receive the delivery on my behalf is apparantly not an option either, so I asked to arrange to collect the phone and the watch on Tuesday 21 March at Waterfall Mall in Rustenburg. This was agreed to. I asked him to repeat all the details of the upgrade which he did at least 3 times. I then asked him if he should not perhaps check with the store if they do have stock, as I do not want to go there and then find out they have no stock. He assured me that they do have the stock and will keep it for me. So far so good, what a wonderful experience and great customer service convincing a customer wanting to cancel his contract to keep him and offering him a good deal.<br /><br />On Monday 20 March, I phoned Vodacom Upgrades again to confirm that all is in order for the collection at Waterfall Mall in Rustenburg. The consultant confirmed that the upgrade has been processed as discussed.<br /><br />Now this is where the disappointment kicks in......<br /><br />On Tuesday 21 March, I went to Waterfall Mall in Rustenburg as arranged (they have 2 Vodacom shops in the mall). I arrived at the first shop and guess what.... They only had the S23 Ultra in Lavender (I asked for black) and they did not have the watch in stock at all. The second shop in the mall did not have stock of the phone or the watch. I then phoned the shop in Rustenburg Mall, and surprise surprise, they do not keep stock of the phone, they only order it in once a customer requires one. By now I am starting to get a little frustrated. I phoned Clearwater Mall in Krugersdorp and yippee they do have stock of the black S23 Ultra, but not of the watch. I said it's ok, I will collect the watch at a later stage.<br /><br />Part 2 of the dissapointment begins when we arrived at Vodacom Clearwater Mall..... I walked in and told the entire story to the consultant. She asked what device I want, what contract, etc etc etc, why I do not understand, as everything have already been captured, I am just there to sign the upgrade and collect the phone. She then asks me if I want the contract on 24 or 36 months. On the phone doing the upgrade, I clearly understood that for Vodacom to give me that deal, they will have to do it on a 36 month contract, which is fine, because the deal from Cell C (for R1719 per month) is on a 36 month contract as well. She then tells me on 36 months, the monthly price will be R2438. I think she saw the disbelief on my face, but I kept my composure and told her nicely : \"No, that is your normal price and that is the reason I wanted to cancel the contract, but on the phone when I wanted to cancel, the consultant arranged a special deal to keep me as a customer\". She went into the profile and printed the upgrade quotation (which for some reason has now been deleted). Now on the cancelled upgrade (for R1878), the consultant only chose a normal S23 Black and not the S23 Ultra like I told him and he confirmed between 5 - 10 times. I told the agent that is the contract I want, but with the S23 Ultra and not the normal S23. She advised that she can give me the same deal in store (with the normal S23), for R1899. What is wrong with the staff at Vodacom, can't they hear the word Ultra????????? I don't want the normal S23, I want the S23 Ultra. After explaining this very calmly to her, she told me then she can't help me, but she sees the upgrade was processed by the Rewards department, and perhaps if I phone them they can sort it out, but I should be careful as this is exactly what they do (promise you one thing and then deliver something else) and then you will have endless problems sorting it out..... Well it seems this was only the beginning of all my problems.<br /><br />On my way home I then phoned Vodacom Upgrades again. I asked to speak to the Rewards department. Apparently this is not possible, so I do not know how they managed to process my upgrade in the first place if I can't speak to them. I then explained the situation to the Upgrades Consultant, but she will try to get hold of them and sort this out. Why can you speak to them, but I am not allowed to. He / she (I can't remember anymore to whom I spoke to, as I spent half the day talking to Vodacom employees), then said that a service request will be logged with the Rewards department as it seems they are closed on a public holiday as she can't get hold of them. I received the sms with the service request number. She told me they will listen to the call recording of the 17th of March and give me a call back between 48 and 72 hours. I knew I was spending a lot of time trying to sort this out, but didn't know that it will take them 2 - 3 days to listen to a 30 minute call recording.<br /><br />I then decided I will wait patiently, and still belief that somehow they will get the recording (which is the first thing you should notice when you speak to them that all calls are recorded) and see somewhere someone made a mistake and just upgrade my damn contract with the pricing as agreed on over the phone. <br /><br />By Thursday 23 March (48 hours later), I received my next sms stating that my request is now being processed and should be resolved by 17:00 on the 28th of March (this is another 5 days). Ok, I decided I will give them the weekend to try and figure this out, but hey they managed to act very quickly as I received another SMS on Friday 12:18 saying they are very optimistic that I enjoyed their service experience and the support ticket is now closed. Really, do you really think I enjoyed this service experience, and now the ticket is closed with absolutely nothing done about it. I did not even get a phone call, the ticket was just closed.<br /><br />I decided that I will go into the weekend and get as far away from a Vodacom signal as possible, maybe I will feel a bit better on Monday, or perhaps something stranged happened over the weekend and by Monday someone with some common sense will walk into the Vodacom Call Centre and answer the phone when I phone them again and start this entire process from scratch.<br /><br />So I had a wonderful weekend and by around midday on Monday I decided to take on the dreadful task of calling Vodacom Upgrades. I am going to keep this part short, as it was a real long and painful experience.<br /><br />I started by explaining the entire situation above (took me about 20 minutes) to the consultant. She then said, no problem she can do the upgrade for me, the monthly cost will be R2438 per month. Really, did you not listen to a single word I just told you? I then asked her how can I get the call recording to take this up with the legal department. She said she will transfer me and I must select option 2. I did exactly as she told me to, unless I have been **** to my entire life and the number 2 is not the same as the word two. Anyway, after pressing 2, I was connected to cancellations. Explained the entire situation again, and guess what, they can't help me because I have reached cancellations. I should phone ********** and select option 2. And guess what department is that..... Maybe you guessed right, it is cancellations. Looks like all the departments that you want to contact is **********, option 2. <br /><br />So now I am really frustrated, about another hour wasted on Vodacom. I decided maybe I should rely on technology and sent a Whatsapp to Toby (the Whatsapp chatbot). After going through the options, I was contacted by an Upgrades consultant. I told her I am not going to repeat myself again. They must look at the service request logged and give me my upgrade at the agreed price or cancel my contract. She quickly told me that this was processed by retentions and she will give them a call. After about 5 minutes, I was then connected to the retentions department. This lady seemed on top of it, as she knew exactly what my problem was and told me the service request was mark as resolved because the upgrade was cancelled (yes it was cancelled because the incorrect device was loaded), but maybe if you phoned me you would've known this. She sincerely apologized and promised to have an answer for me within 24 hours. About 1 hour later, I was called back and told that Vodacom will do a Deal Match, asking what this means, I was told Vodacom will give me exactly the same deal as Cell C (Samsung S23 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy 5 Watch, 3000 minutes and 10GB data for R1719). WOW, eventually someone with some common sense rocked up at Vodacom. I was told that the upgrade will now be processed and they will call me back.....<br /><br />Well, this morning I received a call back, and guess what. Now they can't do the deal match anymore, the best Vodacom can offer me is that contract at R1978, but without the watch. I then said, just leave it and transfer me to cancellations, as I have really had enough now and just want to cancel and port to Cell C. It's been 11 days already and you can still not sort this out. When I spoke to cancellations, once again I was told, I am so sorry about this, and I know you have heard this before, but please can I sort this out for you...... So here I am now, still waiting to have it sorted out. <br /><br />If this is not sorted out by close of business tomorrow, I will cancel my contract (if at all possible, maybe I will manage to get this done in less than a month) and I will go to Cell C, MTN, Telkom or maybe even just get myself a homing ***eon to get my messages delivered, but I will not stay with Vodacom any longer after tomorrow if this is not resolved. |\n",

Are you sure your data isn't finished?\"), making me perform every single action I've already performed 3 times to no avail, I was then instructed to get another phone to put my sim card into to test it as there is nothing wrong on their end so it has to be my device (I guess everybody has a spare device lying around that is 100% compatible with the current one, not sure how because I had to actually get a whole new sim card for this device because the old one simply wouldn't fit).<br />I took the abuse and tried what the gentlemen suggested even though I knew there was nothing wrong with my device, and lo and behold... the exact same thing happened when I put my sim card into a colleagues device, proving that there is in fact nothing wrong with my device. So in short I've wasted close to 5 hours just end up back at square one only now I'm back at the bottom of the queue for the very same issue I tried to report at 10:00 am.<br /><br />This is beyond pathetic, you don't get to blame this one on load shedding as I am pretty sure this is simply an issue of re-sending the network settings for my device to allow me to reconnect, you simply cant be bothered. |\n",

       "| 2023-03-07 11:48:50 | Vodacom | Sim Swap Fraud | I have recieved a sim swap notification on my number yesterday. I imediatly phoned Vodacom customer care and strugled to a point where I eventually got connected to a Agent....well I think it was an Agent. She strugled to understand plain English but I got through to her and she said she reversed the the sim swap and flaged my number for future sim swaps. Then the BOMB. the sim swap went through!!!!!! How the hell did that happen????? I used my daughters phone to phone customer care again as soon as I realized that the network was not down its my number that's not working. Now this is where things get weird. I had the best experience with the Agent that help me this time.....I think his name was Kabelo. He spoke A grade english and helped me with ease. He checked my number but could find no evidence of me phoning in that afternoon( How the hell is that possible?) He assisted in giving me relevant information and reversed the sim swap at the speed of light. Very satisfying service from him. He also flagged my number so that no sim swaps could be done without ID verification. Now I wonder and red flags are flaring up in my head.....This had to be a inside job from vodacom. 1. The sim swap was done using the useless TOBI BOT.<br />2. All the security questions was verrified.<br />3. After reverising the sim swap the first time it was set to still go through.<br />4. No records of me phoning in the first time to do the reversal.<br />5. My bank acount was emptied in the time my number was off and I hold Vodacom pesonnally responsible for this.<br /><br />I remember when I was working for vodacom the Security was very strict on sim swaps. How did Vodacom sink so low as to let a robot do a sim swap?<br /><br />Vodacom realy has to revise their sim swap procedure. |\n",

I AGAIN phoned Cancellations and the woman that answered the call was extremely rude telling me that the no. does not belong to me and said to phone the billing department.  I phoned Billing and gave the exact details that I gave to this unmannered woman at cancellations and the lady tried assisting but said I have to contact Cancellations.

How incompetent.  Mvelo assured me that the matter will be escalated and I will receive feedback with 48 hours.  Needless to say, NO FEEDBACK!!!!!!! This is totally unacceptable and I WILL NOT be held liable for Vodacom’s incompetency.  Should this matter not be resolved IMMEDIATELY, I will report this to ICASA!

This process has taken nearly 4 weeks before ot was approved. We were never once phoned by the consultant Wiehan. He made numerous errors in beginning when we applied for the contract resulting in unnecessary delays. We had to visit the branch every day to get an update. After 2 weeks they finally decided my joint bank account with my husband is causing issues and he now needs to submit forms as well alon with ID. This done we were told we will have an answer the next day. Come next day oh no sorry Wiehan only copied front of ID both sides is needed. We emailed a new copy of ID and again told by end of today you will have your contract. Again no feedback and we went back to store only to be told still pending. This pending process took 5 days. Finally I received message that contract is approved, but still no feedback from Wiehan. We went there today to sign and collect phone, no phone in sight. Turns out they only ordered.the phone last week after tellin me it was order when we did application. They said phone is coming Friday, than next Friday and than next Friday and now today it is moved to Tuesday next week. This is the worst network provider to take out a contract with and worst part we cannot cancel because Vodacom is not answerng their phones.

Last Sunday I decided to chat with their agent which felt like I was speaking to a bot because of the copied and pasted templates and they refused to answer my questions but at that point I understood I was mis sold at point of sale and they clearly wasn't Willing to help so I asked for a manager I was given an email to email which when I did email they email failed because their inbox was full so I got back the chat line and the agent logged me a complaint and said a manager will contact me within 72 working hours. I told her I was off Wednesday so can she get them to call me then and she agreed I got an email and SMS as well. They call me on Tuesday whilst I'm at work the manager from the store that I took the contract called I told her call Tomorrow after 10am as I was busy at work she agreed and we ended the call. Wednesday comes no call so I call in and I had such a nightmare I was passed to so many departments the agent that helped me in the billing team couldn't even tell me when my contract ends I also asked to increase my LTE plan as the data had become too less and she told me it isn't possible I must wait till 2024 when my contract would be long over then I spoke to the retentions team who didn't even understand they called retentions because they are a last resort in trying to maintain a customer the guy then transferred me to sales who agreed to do the upgrade after speaking but at that point I wanted a manager and for cheaper data plan because he was selling me some unnecessary plan I did not need he then went twice to get a manager and placed a very long hold twice he then comes back and says a manager will take the call places me on hold and never gets back to me I eventually had to drop the line I called again and was pasted to pillar to post and was refused a manager I requested for a subject access request as I wanted to take this further but I don't think they understand by law how serve that request is it was dreadful customer service and experience especially being mis sold if you are looking for a company please don't choose this one they may be cheaper but they are the worst they internet connection is even worse don't waste your time |\n",

Its response time is extremely slow, it freezes and has to be restarted several times a day, it is frequently not responsive to touch, and often cuts off calls or the other party can no longer hear me.<br /><br />I took the device to a Vodacom4U shop today, and the service consultant tested the tablet and agreed that it is unacceptably defective.  However, he also informed me that I was not permitted to cancel the contract, and said the only way to remedy the situation would be to take out yet another contract with a new device, while continuing to pay for a contract that includes a device that doesn't work, until December 2024.<br /><br />In terms of the Consumer Protection Act, this conduct by Vodacom is illegal. I have tried to raise the matter with your customer care line, but was directed to a bot that was unable to assist me.  It was impossible to find an actual human to assist me.<br /><br />In terms of applicable legislation, I have the following rights:<br /><br />   The supply and use of goods that are free of defects and of a quality that consumers have a right to expect. Suppliers are required to remedy defects in goods supplied or refund. <br /><br />    Goods of good quality, in good working order, and free of defects.<br /><br />In terms of the Act, Vodacom implied a warranty of quality by making the offer, i.e. that I should have been provided with goods that are good quality.  It is my right to return the defective tablet, without penalty and at Vodacom's risk and expense, within 6 months if it is of inferior quality or defective - which it is, as confirmed by your representative this morning.  I then have the right to choose whether Vodacom refunds, repairs or replaces my device, and I want a complete refund.<br /><br />Naturally I also want to cancel this contract due to poor quality & defects in the device you supplied, and the Act clearly states that Vodacom may not use this as grounds to enter into a new agreement (which is what your consultant to whom I spoke this morning tried to do).<br /><br />I am justifiably frustrated with the poor performance of the device, the untruthful advice from Vodacom that I may not cancel the contract, and that Vodacom's customer care call center is, in fact, a bot.<br /><br />As a loyal and longstanding client, I am disappointed in your service and the obstacles Vodacom has put in the way of resolving these issues. Please reply with a confirmation that this contract has been cancelled and details of my refund.  I expect this matter to be resolved within 24 hours of making this complaint. |\n",

After requesting call backs,  nothing.  On one specific call we were told the technician would contact us,  when we asked if that would indeed happen we were told.  \"I don't know\".  Worst of all.  We paid in advance for this service so I suspect this company does not give a damn if they do not provide the service. I mean they already received the money.  This seems to be a scam of sorts. |\n",

The only store in Vereeniging is in Three Rivers Mall and without having transport it makes it difficult for me to go there. I took the phone to Vaal mall with a taxi only to find that they are just an outlet, just there to sit and turn people away.<br /><br />So, I have a phone that I can hardly use for 3 hours a day without losing battery power. I was stuck on the freeway with my GPS that just died last month. I then checked all the problems that comes with this phone and yup this is one useless piece of nonsense I have to pay R1217x36months for??<br /><br />You should have warned me before sending me this **** about all the faults this phone comes with. How do you expect me to pay CellC this amount of money and not have a phone available all day?<br />OVerheating Overheating Overheating. THe battery does not last for more than 4 hours which means it is useless as the phone will heat up so much that it actually feels like it will explode in your hands. <br /><br />My phone is forms part of my income as I need to take photos of buildings when I go to site.

An advance of R140 against my numbers was taken and transferred along with my airtime by the criminals to their numbers and vodacom promised to cancel the advance and a reference number was issued for my case, 7 days down the line I'm still owing the R140 advance nothing has been done to atleast cancel the advance, when i call their consultants they say i must wait 7 working days for feedback. I can't even access mobile banking because i dont have airtime and i can't  make fonecalls ,the least i expected vodacom to do was to expedite the advance <br />cancellation since it is their fault that this stupid TOBI technology is so weak that criminals are now able to manipulate it to do sim swaps, but no im told to wait 7 working days for feedback. I am not going to buy back that advance from my own pocket for their fault, never. I wish i could switch to other networks,  it's a pity that im stuck with this useless network because most of my things are linked to my vodacom numbers,  but one day things will change.

I left the branch being reassured by 2 consultants that I will be charged X amount with my new invoice.<br /><br />Surprise Surprise, new invoice received, still the same double charge.<br /><br />I called the branch and spoke to Katlego who advised me that she is looking into it and will call me back.

       "| 2023-01-10 12:44:24 | Cell C | Once Upon a Tablet... | Dear Reader, happy 2023. I can't believe that it's been almost 7 months since this whole mess started. This means that I am about a quarter of the way into my journey with Cell C - time is flying.<br /><br />First off a quick reminder of how I go here and why I'm posting this message.<br /><br />In July of 2022 I decided to exercise a long overdue upgrade option on my contract with Cell C. I opted for a Samsung Tablet [that could take a Sim and SD card - more on this later] <br /><br />The Tablet delivered promptly. For various reasons it was a few days before I unboxed the tablet and took it out for a test drive. I switched the Tablet on and followed the onscreen prompts and after a few minutes I arrived at the Home screen. So far so good.<br /><br />To insert a Sim card one needs to power down the device, eject the sim tray with the tool provided, place the sim card in the tray, then insert the sim tray back into the device. This is where the fun begins.<br /><br />When I tried to insert the sim tray, there was resistance. I immediately put the tablet back in the original packaging and headed towards the nearest branch of Cell C - this was a fruitless exercise. <br /><br />Fast forward about 2 months - after having given up on getting this matter resolved - I was contacted by someone at Cell C who arranged for me to hand the tablet in for assessment. Photos were taken, the tablet was switched on and off - it was then packaged up and sent in for 'assessment' <br /><br />a couple of days later I received a call from an assessor, he advised me that the repairs to the tablet would cost about the same [or more] than a new tablet. my response can't be published as there was quite a bit of profanity involved. Needless to say I rejected the assessment and the device was returned to me.<br /><br />So I am now the proud owner of a device that has limited use. I advised Cell C that I would post on this platform every month until my contract expires. There have been responses to my posts. Someone at cell c called me a liar and said I damaged the tablet on purpose [which makes no sense - if it got damaged during the last month of my contract then.....]. On another occasion I was contacted and arrangements were made to have the tablet re-assessed, having low expectations of Cell C I wasn't surprised when the device was never collected.<br /><br />So, in summary, if you get a device from these guys, OPEN IT WHILE YOU ARE IN THE STORE - make sure it does what it is supposed to do and that everything fits where it's supposed to fit.<br /><br />And to the Cell C robot that reads this message, please don't bother calling me, I will not pick up - our relationship, is over. |\n",

I spoke with numerous agents and sent all the documentation to the cancellations department, where I got a response from the BOT saying that my early cancellation had been received. The problem is now, even after stopping the contract and paying the penalty, Vodacom is still taking money off my account. They took money, Nov, Dec and now JANUARY as well, which means that they - without my approval continued the contract!!! This company is a scam and has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! I need this matter resolved as soon as possible, and I would like the money taken from my account to be paid back!!!!!!!

I made plans to take time off work to go in and make the payment required including the month ahead. I also inquired about converting my number to pay as you go. As happy as they were to take the money they immediately shut up shop and mentioned I'd have to get in queue and have a different person help me. I did not have time for that, so they said I could call a number for reconnection. That number gives you very little option, either for upgrade or a service bot. The whole time informing you of how they care. The service bot is so friggen useless. It said I would be rconected twice. This did not happen. It has been a whole day. I have turned off after an hour after each call as instructed and still nothing. I even lied and contacted someone about an upgrade, which I do qualify for and asked them to put me through to someone about reconnecting. They did... They promised to call back they didn't. The 4 times I have tried since then I have been hung up on all four times. I give up. Someone needs to contact me. I just want to have my phone connected again. I'm over the exhaustive ineptitude of your entire company. Once that is done, I want to covert my number to pay as you go. The lack of care and  malice from your staff is excruciatingly painful.

I explained that I work abroad and would need international roaming to be active to receive OTP's from my SA bank accounts. The consultant advised me this was easy to setup and reassured me that I can have international roaming on a Vodacom PAYG SIM card. I stressed to her the importance of needing this to work properly as I depended on it for conducting business back in SA while working abroad. After again being reassured by her that this would not be a problem, I purchased a new phone and SIM card, on a 'Power bonus' PAYG package. I followed her advice and activated international roaming by calling 082 135 and then using the Tobi SMS bot. I then rechecked before departure and again received SMS notification that Vodafone world roaming was indeed active. I have subsequently switched and updated all my banking and investment contact details to my new Vodacom number however, upon my arrival in the UK, I am unable to connect to any mobile network here. If I search manually, networks of the Vodacom roaming partners are available but all show 'forbidden' and prevent me from connecting. I cannot receive any calls or smses to my new Vodacom number. I have restarted my phone numerous times without. If I go on the Vodacom app it says I am ineligible for roaming but if I contact 'Tobi' via WhatsApp (using WiFi) it says that I am already setup for roaming with Vodafone World. I don't understand this discrepancy. I tried emailing customer care and was again referred to the chatbot Tobi which is useless as it keeps telling me I am already registered for roaming despite it not working. I need this resolved ASAP as I need to be able to access my internet banking and other financial institutions. I was promised by the consultant prior to sale that I would not have an issue with roaming yet here I am, stick without connectivity and needing to do business. I cannot be called on my Vodacom number and I cannot call the call centre either as I am already abroad and have no mobile network connectivity. I need someone to email me or call me on an alternative UK number to urgently activate my roaming!! Please help!!! I have been unable to reach Vodacom thus far! |\n",

Their systems & procedures are rigged to only get access to your bank account and take your money. <br /><br />1 November 2022 I signed up for a new Data SIM on contract with Vodacom SA. After many! attempts for nearly 2 weeks to actually speak with someone on a call or email, their system just keeps pushing you into loops with their stupid \"Tobi\" robot that does not even have the intelligence to recognize your question. The package was delivered Thursday 10 Nov. But it was the wrong product. The SIM did not work in my mobile router as ordered. <br /><br />I could not get any answer from Vodacom via phone, email or Whatsapp system. Email auto reply says this channel is discontinued and to contact \"Tobi\" by phone or Whatsapp. On phone & Whatsapp, \"Tobi\" is programmed to tell you to email them. I even tried Twitter but those people could not even read simple English as they failed to answer to my actual question. Immediately Monday 14 Nov (3 days after SIM activation), I went in to their shop and there I was put in phone contact with an actual person. To fix the problem of the wrong product, they had to cancel the contract and collect the delivered product. <br /><br />I had to contact Vodacom again on 17 + 23 + 28 Nov because both the contract calcellation or the product collection has not been done yet. So the product was finally collected 30 Nov. <br /><br />But on 8 December I phoned Vodacom again to find out why I have not yet received the contract cancellation notice via email as I was told repeatedly. I only goy a voice recording that said \"Our call center detects a high number of calls from your number. Your number is blocked to protect the system from fraudulant activity. You have to call ********** / ********** @ R2.00/minute for further help.” SERIOUSLY!!! blocked for fraudulant activity!? <br /><br />On 9 Dec I called the same Vodacom Billing Support numbers using family members phone. After speaking with someone I spoke with on 17 Nov, she put me through to the \"cancellation dept\". There I was put through to someone else again. After having to explain EVERYTHING AGAIN and a very long conversation, this guy confirmed his job was just to GET ME TO BUY ANOTHER CONTRACT! He was not able to cancel the contract but he said \"did send an email to the \"cancellation dept\". <br /><br />At the shop they say they can not help me and I have to speak with those people on the phone. It just keeps going in circles and every time they lead you to *just another sales person* trying to sell you something.<br /><br />Today after 49 days Vodacom is still taking my money from my bank for this contract of an incorrect product which I do even not have any longer after they collected it from me.<br /><br />So what are we to do? How do we get Vodacom to actually deliver the product & service they sell us?<br />Can anyone help me please? |\n",

Top 3 worst experiences of my life. | Dear Vodacom,<br /><br />I have recently signed up for a contract with your establishment, the sales people where brimming and full of enthusiasm, in contrast to the utterly abysmal services rendered.<br /><br />1. I have paid for extra 40mins a day Any time Voice. But it does not seem to have worked this past two months - the robotic voice asking me to recharge every chance it gets. I require my phone in order to do my business. This cuts of my hands and disables me from doing what I need to. Even with mundane tasks such as phonining a mechanic to checkup on my car's servicing.<br /><br />2. The mobile data only works for 15 minutes after resetting my phone, this adds to immense frustration with your establishment as I require it for Google Maps to give real time information. Picture driving on the N1 and the internet just dropping. Now I have to juggle around to reset the phone which takes atleast 5 minutes, then switch on mobile data and type in coordinates again. This can easily take 3 -4 hours a day and runs the risk of my attention elsewhere whilst in traffic.<br /><br />3. The phone itself is giving of echo's while phoning customers. Its not even 5 months old.<br /><br />4. Trying to get a human on the other end of your customer care line is near impossible.<br /><br />I have to say I had no queries being on prepaid due to the costing schemes you use. It does not seem you have any systems or trained professionals in place to maintain your contracts. I'd pay you R1000 000 if there was no other issues like this which I'm quite sure you have on a regular basis indicating decay of your administrative institutions.<br /><br />I will be going forward bringing up in every conversation to friends, colleagues and strangers that I walk into, that they should avoid Vodacom like the black plague or air born Ebola.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and attention reading the abovementioned - I hope it can at least cause some self reflectance and improvement to Vodacom. I am utterly disappointed and regret ever signing a contract with an institution so inept in a super saturated market regarding telecommunications. |\n",

I mean what kind of a network service providers tells you that you have called outside their operating hours? So people must die cause y'all don't wanna employ people but your useless robot tshepo?? Then whenever you eventually manage to request a call back your lazy agent calls after  and keeps quiet for a whole 2 mins after that he ends the call by ending task on the pc and I'm left with dead air on the call. I am absolutely ashamed that I even advocated for y'all, telling people that they are the one's who went wrong but now I see that everyone is right. Y'all don't care about your clients at all and I'm absolutely disgusted with the way treat customers. I bought a bundle on Saturday, you guys deducted money from my airtime immediately but even today you have not loaded my bundle. Had to get more data to even query this with y'all and all that you do is make a fool out of me. Even to write this review I had to buy more data to try and get data that I bought from y'all. So when y'all see this you must make sure you resolve this matter so I can get my data. I will use it up so quick together with the rest of my balances so I can part ways with y'all  because I am so done with y'all. |\n",

Why was I being forced to pay Rain R699 every month?<br /><br />After having to repeat the same thing over and over (several hours and money wasted) to get someone to take my request for account cancellation seriously, it all became a circus again. <br /><br />On 25 November 2022, they debited my account after telling me explicitly that no more debits will be made. When I finally reached someone about this, they specifically said that I will get a refund in 7 - 10 working days. I never got my money. <br /><br />After waiting about 12 working days for my refund, I called them and was told that someone from Billing would call me back. No one called. All I received was an email saying that they don't owe me money and that I owed them money. Plus, I received an sms saying that my account will be debited early for December 2022. Which account? The one I requested that they close in February 2022?<br /><br />This company has caused me extreme stress and anxiety, I'm actually traumatised by this ongoing experience. They seem hell-bent on not giving me my refund, and trying to take even more money from my bank account for no service delivered.<br /><br />I cannot believe that a company like Rain is actually allowed to operate - they do not treat their customers fairly.

Every month there is some sad story and I'm told it won't happen again but again it's happened.<br />Last month I commented on their Facebook post about my issues and they reply with my account history which to my knowledge is private information despite the fact that some of the information was incorrect it also proved that they debited me on a date not agreed upon. <br />They don't answer calls yet they make us chat to robots on their social media platforms. <br />I'm not sure why the store consultants can't assist us as they are more competent. |\n",

Our wifi lost internet connectivity and upon contacting Vodacom, it transpired that the issue was with the Vodacom router. Vodacom had advised that they have a 24 hour to 36 hour turnaround time to send a technician to my home to give us a new router. It’s 5 days and NO ONE from Vodacom has contacted us. When I followed up 3 days later, I was told that they tried to get hold of us and they were unsuccessful. It turns out the number they apparently used to “contact us” is wrong yet the very same company does security checks using our correct cellphone number. Definitely appears to me that we are being told lies that we were contacted by their technicians when no one contacted us.  They have promised to escalate the matter and still the matter remains unresolved and no one has contacted us. They have costed me so much of money as I work from home so I have had to buy lots of data and use my phone as a hotspot and since the phone is not a strong internet connection point, I have lost connectivity during important meetings which has made me lose credibility. It’s totally appalling that they treat customers like this. The worst part is that we can’t even buy our own router and plug it in because their technicians need to come out and programme everything. If you want a service provider that will give you ZERO service when you have problems with your wifi connectivity and will leave you stranded for days without internet connectivity , then Vodacom fibre is for you. Their call centre agents have also been trained to respond like robots and “apologise for the inconvenience caused” and the minute the call ends, your query  is all forgotten and nothing gets done while you continue to suffer as a customer |\n",

Some months ago SMS's were sent to customers to opt in subscribing to some premium Vodamail service at R29/month. Then Vodacom changed the service (seemingly) to some web based email service and one could no longer log into Vodamail web page - downgrading the service in effect. Eventually the SMS said \"if you don't opt out by return SMS the R29/month would be deducted off airtime\". I opted out as I do not need any premium Vodamail account, yet I have been using my Vodamail email for many years. Somehow I am paying for the service anyway. Since yesterday (and again today) I've received SMS's from a Vodacom SMS service (which you can not respond to) saying \"to keep your Vodamail service active, please ensure that you have an airtime balance of R29,00 between 25-30 October 2022\". At no point in time have I agreed to this deduction and can't call the Vodacom \"customer care\" center as the call is diverted to some robotic AI gimmick which is totally useless. There is no option to resolve a matter with a staff member! REALLY????

My phone has been stolen and albeit me reporting this the morning after to obtain the ITC number, there was still fraudulent transactions happening on the old Sim card. <br />When I phoned accounts, they said I must wait for the month end run before I could lodge a query on the account. Now working with the different call centers and loosing valuable billable time I've decided to take the knock. <br />A good 6 weeks later you decide without notice to Suspend my number.

Vodacom it is clear you are not interested in Customer Service at all:<br />- No communication to loyal customers (or any customer for that matter)when you are disabling a service/line<br />- extremely poor mobile app. Even the consultants at the shops complain about the inability to basically to anything on the app<br />- your bot is hanging when I try to interact with the same<br />- no escalation service. <br />Can you please get your house in order, spend a little less on marketing and bring your systems processes and client service to a level that one expect of a group like yourselves. <br />I've cried and screamed at your poor call Centre agents and shop assistants, but they are just as lost as me in your not serving corporate broken structures and systems.<br />At this stage I think the South African Police service gives better service than Vodacom. |\n",

       "| 2022-09-22 09:13:21 | Cell C | Good products, the worst customer service | Cell C is by far one of the worst companies I have experienced with regard to customer service.  I have been a customer of theirs for far too long and it is something I am regretting.  It is a pity because some of their offerings are attractive but good luck if something goes wrong.<br /><br />Many of their customer service agents stick to reading their scripts like robots and don't have the insight to listen to what is being said.<br /><br />In the most recent incident, in preparation to conduct business during load shedding, I purchased a 2GB daytime data for 7 days bundle.  I also have more than sufficient night time data available,  On Tuesday morning when I woke up I was greeted with a message that my data balance was 0.  I contacted Cell C customer care and they had me believe that something on my phone had used my data from 6am onwards.... even though my phone was on wifi and my personal hotspot switched off.  I then bought an additional 2GB of data to get me through the day's loadshedding.  I also restarted my phone.  My data was again depleted when I checked at around 10am.  Again I contacted customer care and another robotic employee told me I didnt pass the security questions even though I answered all correctly.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told I cannot because I didn't pass the security questions.  A subsequent helpful agent looked into the data and also admitted something odd was going on and that it was impossible for me to have used all that data in the short space of time she could see on her system.  She informed me that a case was opened and told me that I would receive feedback within 2 working days.  I explained the urgency of this needing to be corrected as it would also be futile to purchase more data if it just depletes within minutes.<br />Without hearing from anyone that day, I decided to switch my mobile data completely off before going to bed.  The next morning, my 2 GB allocation was again depleted.  Again I contacted customer care and again explained the urgency.  Again the case was 'edged' or flagged for attention.  Again nobody contacted me.  It is now the 3rd day and no surprise, my 2GB daily allocated data is depleted and also no surprise the case is still not resolved.<br /><br />This type of customer service opened up another wound I have with Cell C.  In 2020 my mother, who's Cell C contract I was paying passed away.  I sent an email to *********** on 16/11/2020 providing a copy of her ID and death certificate and requesting her contract to be cancelled.  After no response and calling the dreaded customer care I was provided with an email address *********** and advised to also state that I am the next of kin.  I did that and no surprise, was no response ... and the debit orders continued to go off my bank account,  I cannot even tell you how many hours of calls I made to customer care ... and experiencing the same promises of being contacted within 2 days which never materialized.  As the debit orders continued to be debited I decided to reverse the last few I could, all the while phoning and phoning customer care.  I was eventually provided with another email address, ***********.  When emailing that email it returned with an error that the mailbox was full.  I sent an email to all addresses providing them with a letter of executorship and requesting re-imbur*****t for the moneys debited out of my account since first providing proof to them of my mother's death.  To date they have not bothered to pay me back a cent although it seems they did eventually close down the account. |\n",

       "| 2022-08-11 17:21:39 | Telkom | Horrific client service | I got fibre installed in May and clearly stipulated that my debit order date should be on the 20th. However the consultant that was capturing my application made it the 10th. The debit order did not go through the first month and I had to make a cash payment, I contacted the call centre again and spoke to a different consultant who advised me that my date could not be changed within the first 3 months of my contract. I have been calling Telkoms contact centre every month to have this change as this is an inconvenience to me. The consultants do not care to help the clients but instead keep me reading me a script as if they are robots. I've asked numerous times to speak to the supervisor but not once have I had any luck getting through to them, it's like they don't exist. I am frustrated and appalled at the service I'm receiving from Telkom. Every consultant tells me there's nothing they can do and refuse to transfer me to their senior. I've never received such disgusting client service from an institution, it's like when other companies take their staff for service excellence they are trained on trying to outdo other companies with the worst service possible. The last call I made I spoke to Neliswa who decided to put the phone to the side while she continues with I don't know what until the call centre closes. I do not think it's fair that as a client they can't fix their mistake and I have to suffer for it. I have sent an email to Robyn who gave me a dispute no and told me to call after 3-7 working days and made calls but no one seems to want to assist me. My account keeps going into arrears because the debit order is not received on the date they've captured. I regret getting Telkom fibre as this is the worst client experience I've ever encountered! |\n",

MY ACCOUNT IS UP TO DATE I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING - except the monthly instalment of August 2022.

OPTION 5 advised that I should go online and do the cancellation services according to the robot over the phone, no physical person spoke to me . I tried it again was no success I have tried an alternative technique of emailing Telkom fibre broadband Services on the following address; *********** my first attempt was on the 24 April 2022 ref: ********** explaining the situation in this email and on another attempt which would be on the 3 May 2022 ref: ********** in all methods and attempts have recieved no call level of service or a response or  assistance till date. I really do regret as Customer to why did I go for this service very dissassifying. I cannot pay for a service that I am not happy hence its my money I am paying so I do deserve a good customer care service and a high standard of delivery as I am the Customer. This service is not coming free to do as your please with customers I am paying for it and should be galdy satisfied as a paying customer bear that in mind. I do not know the way forward as a customer we are already and June and my money is going to a service I don't need according to my explained email on on above mentioned dates. This is not  right and fair to me as a customer. This service don't even deserve one star. Very disappointing..... with such a service. VERY UNHAPPY to such services in my life. Honestly...... |\n",

Tried for half an hour to get to speak to a consultant as the bot was of no help. I spoke to a Thato Kqomthao which was of no help whatsoever. I was put on hold many times just to be told his system is loading and it will take an hour. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told the manager is in a meeting and will be available after an hour. He kept saying he will call me back in an hour. I kept telling him I also work in a call center and won't be able to take a call, but the more he kept going on he will call back. I could hear in the background someone guiding him where to check, when I asked to speak to that person I was told that person was on a call (this person had put their client on hold to help thato), but a few seconds later I heard the person in the background answer a new call. My issue has still not been fixed, no managers are available and their systems loads for an hour. WOW WHAT PATHETIC SERVICE FROM SUCH A BIG SERVICE PROVIDER. Get consultants that can actually help clients and remove the bot, it doesn't help/work. I want a senior manager to get in contact with me ASAP |\n",

Another circle.<br />Clicking on “frequently asked questions” has no reaction on your site.<br />I few days ago I got through to a HUMAN (Imagine that)…..but, alas, they were clueless and I got the wrong info.<br /><br />Is Vodacom now also being managed by the government?<br />Is there NO way one can complain about rubbish service?<br /><br />To make it worse the question is not even difficult.<br /><br />I purchased a prepaid sim.<br />It does not work in my tracking device. <br /><br />Upon getting support from the manufacturer they tell me to:<br />\"Please ask the operator what the APN of the new SIM card is, and the user name and password of the APN”<br />Now that seems a reasonable request…..except that my OPERATOR is clueless.<br /><br />So here goes.

       "| 2022-06-22 14:12:16 | Vodacom | Vodacom online deals are a SCAM | This company may as well rename itself to Vodascam, or Voda****s, or something of that nature, because their ONLINE deals are not a reflection of their actual contract prices. Their stupid robot changed the order I made for my wife's phone the next morning, adding a whopping R120 to the monthly bill for exactly the same thing. We thought this was erroneous, so we ignored the SMS. We did not confirm it, but they shipped the order anyway. Then they shipped it to the wrong address. They refused to accept a third party delivery (a.k.a. Me, because my wife cannot receive deliveries during the day), even though my work address was already verified under her account as a 3rd party. This meant that we never even got the phone after a month of waiting. They wasted everyone's time, including the courier (RAM) who went to the same old address where she no longer lives, about 5 times. Upon phoning the after-sales number we got from a Vodacom shop employee, they told me she could change the delivery address over the phone, so I relayed this to my wife and told her to phone them. Then they told her that they can't. That's the point when they also told her that the contract we bought does not allow Top-Ups and is actually R419/pm instead of R299/pm as per the \"online exclusive\" - and that they will change out-of-bundle rates for going over 500MB/month, which is NOT WHAT A TOP-UP CONTRACT IS. But they defended themselves, because if you go onto their website, their description of top-up and normal contracts are exactly the same. Top-up now also bills you after you use your data. This company is scamming people with misleading advertising and wording and a stupid ****ing robot that is utterly useless. It's swallowed my airtime before expiry multiple times before, but that's another issue entirely. |\n",

       "| 2022-06-18 08:12:31 | Vodacom | UNETHICAL SERVICE CONTINUOUS LET DOWNS | Attention: Vodacom <br /><br />Re: Unauthorized line activated on my name.<br /><br />To whom it may concern, <br /><br />On Monday I saw an ad vodacom had a special. 2x iPhone 8 for R329pm. I called around your stores to see who had stock.<br /><br />Your store, Vodacom 4u Berea, East London told me they can do it on the same phone, however only the 256gb model as they did not have stock of the 64gb model on special. Melozan told me it will cost a bit more, I was happy with this. I gave her my ID number to see if I qualify. <br /><br />Tuesday afternoon after various emails to your staff member, I went into the store to follow up. I was told only 1 has approved, the other is still in. I was a bit confused as I am aware of it only being 1 deal. Wednesday morning I got an email from vodacom with a quote on the package approved. I saw it was 1 phone and it was R299. This was not what I wanted. I then made a call to the store and spoke to Angus and he told me Melozan was on leave. I was a bit annoyed and asked what is going on, Angus asked for my details and he would call back (I'm still waiting) during this time I called online sales for the correct package to order online. I was told the following by your online sales.<br /><br />- the store had done 4 applications on me<br />(I asked for 1, who gave permission to do 4?)<br /><br />- she told me 2 separate packages were put through and 1 was declined as they approved 1 and only 1 contract can be taken out at a time which confused me even more.<br /><br />- I was then told that the store had to reverse the activation before online can do anything. (This made me very cross that someone was activated on my name without my authority)<br /><br />- online told me the reversal is very quick and I can then call back to proceed.<br /><br />What a mission! Your store was not concerned about me and my request for the stuff up they made. I am now dealing with Angus as Melozan is off and Angus is ignoring me.<br /><br />Since then I have had many emails sent to your complaints (you keep emailing me to authenticate my account) which I do yet get no response. This is typical of vodacom. I have been speaking to comeone on your social media but feels like I am speaking to a robot because the same questions get asked and things get lost in translation. Still no phone call from anyone! Have even written on hello peter.<br /><br />The same time I got notification that vodacom did 4 credit checks on me. Do you know 1 credit check alone drops an individuals score? Nevermind you did FOUR in 1 day without my permission!<br /><br />I then see a number that is not part of my numbers all of a sudden appear on my dashboard on the app. This must be the unauthorized line activated.<br /><br />Eventually I got a sms yesterday that the activation was canceled. I gave the reference number to your robot on fb so they could proceed with the correct online double deal I wanted.<br /><br />I now get a msg saying I was declined recently, I can only try again in 6 months. How was I declined if we had to reverse an activated line? If there was any decline that is because your store messed up! <br /><br />With all of this I had to do the running around. Your PATHETIC complaints team kept telling me to follow up with the store, the same store who was ignoring me.<br /><br />I wake up this morning and an unauthorized debit order has now been taken off my account..  who gave you this permission? I have reversed this debit as you cannot take money that does not belong to you. This reversal now costs money. Again still not a single thing on the package I requested.<br /><br />15 years of being a contract customer with vodacom. Not once have 1 ever missed a payment or chosen to leave, but I am now fed up with your service service actually how you don't care. You have done many things above without my authorization and against my will.<br /><br />I am escalating this to the NCR and the telecommunications Ombudsman and until then I will be sure to cancel my debit order with vodacom. |\n",

I purchased 2 GB data for R149 at 09:45 on 02/05/2022 only to have my router fail to connect to the Vodacom network. After consulting with the vodacom shop that issued the sim card, I was informed that the number no longer belonged to me because it was in disuse for 3 months and that I would be unable to receive a refund for the data loaded on the number via internet banking. I was never warned that the number would be removed from my name. This is something even Telkom managed to do in the past. Not alerting clients that their number will be removed from service and reassigning these numbers to a new person presents a major security risk. I am tired of \"speaking\" to \"Toby\", your useless chatbot and I cannot get hold of a human. Should this be the level of service I can expect of Vodacom, I would rather go back to Cell-C and deal with their load-shedding outages. |\n",

Theoretical scenarios were given as a resolution which, and the only thing achieved was a waste of my time, and infuriating.<br /><br />I got a contract with Vodacom for a Tablet for my son, the number that came with it is defect. By that I mean I can not call him, calls from a cellphone do not go through, regardless of the network.<br />Also, he can not receive sms's, he only gets marketing texts and Nedbank notifications meant for user that Vodacom assigned the number to prior to me/my son (I assume).  I have tried multiple times as mentioned before calling the call center but the options given by TOBI do not address this issue.<br /><br />I sent an email which seemed to attract a back and forth that required me to do authentication. The type of work I do and responsibilities at home as a mother, wife, daughter in-in-law does not allow me the luxury of leaving things unresolved the first time, hence I preferred calling but 135 (Tobi's play ground) has been unable to assist or give an option to speak to a live person who can hear and understand nuanced issues not pre-programed on Tobi.<br /><br />The number in question is **********.

I was charged for the activation and have been paying a monthly fee for the OneNumber service. Unfortunately, the service has mysteriously stopped working. I have tried emailing Vodacom - no reply. Then I tried the Tobi chatbot - useless. Then I spoke to a consultant - equally as clueless. She kept telling me to activate the service that is already activated!  I am still being charged for a service that does not work. The iPhone Watch app shows the Vodacom plan as \"not in use\". The watch, when tapping the icon to activate mobile data, shows a black screen. Turning everything on and off DOES NOT WORK VODACOM. Nobody seems to know what the hell is happening. I delayed upgrading with Vodacom for years but eventually succumbed and boy do I regret it. I cannot seem to get any competent assistance with this. |\n",

The phone came back and it was a dual Sim with the same issue and if I phone from Sim 1 the other people can't hear me and say it sounds like a robot so I took it back for the 4th time and asked them to cancel the contract as I have been paying the whole time and not having a phone or let me take a different phone like Samsung or something with the same value but not a Huawei but that did not happen and I am still waiting for the phone as they sent it to Cape Town instead of Port Elizabeth as I went in to the store to find out what's going on for about the 30th time.

There was about R20 of airtime left on it. Admittedly it was used intermittently over the years as it only sent alarm activation sms's and occasional test reports. But it was active. It was even linked to my active profile  on the Vodacom  website. In addition my security system has been compromised for a time of which I was not aware , which could have exposed me to danger and loss of goods.<br />They have now allocated my sim card number to another client.<br /> <br />It is futile to contact Vodacom as all one gets is an automated response and a computer Bot who cannot deal with out of the ordinary problems. This is a frustrating practise of large corporations like Vodacom these days. There is no provision by these corporations like Vodacom  for any means by their clients to get personal service or to contact someone to assist or to be able to contact a Manager. The Managers and Directors have placed themselves beyond reach of their clients.<br />So now I have no recourse or means of getting a refund of my airtime from Vodacom  which they appropriated for themselves or even an explanation as to why they cancelled my sim card.<br />I am intending to lay a charge in the Small Claims Court against Vodacom and subpoena  their MD appear before it, as a matter of principle. |\n",

       "| 2022-03-07 09:55:51 | MTN South Africa  | Pathetic level of service | Thursday morning I sent a mail through to the complaints department, voicing my utter disgust at the service I have been receiving from one of your branches. Now, two days later I have still heard nothing from anyone. <br /><br />I suppose you have the sale, making your money monthly, so why should you give a rats ass about the problems people are experiencing!!<br /><br />This was what I sent through last Thursday....<br /><br />Several months ago, I upgraded my cell phone contract with MTN at your Checkers Norkem Park branch. I have always had Samsung devices, but got assured by the sales people there that the new HiSense device was a better option. <br /><br />I have been back to the shop a few times to complain about problems that I have been experiencing with the phone, which they have tried to remedy, and in the end, just tell me that they are not sure what could be the problem. Thats where it has been left. The problems that I mentioned to them, have increased, and a number of other problems have begun with the phone. <br /><br />Roughly 3 weeks ago, I went into the shop, to ask if they had a spare device, they could loan me so that I could send my phone in for repairs. They said they didn't have a spare device with internet abilities, but rather a cheap entry level phone, but would arrange with HiSense to bring a spare device through for me to use while mine was in for repairs. I explained the need for an Android device, as I deal with the mining industry, and have to be reachable 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency. I went back to the shop where I took my contract through on Friday the 25th February, to find out if they had managed to arrange a spare phone. Only then did they get in touch with HiSense, to see if one could be arranged. Nearly 2 weeks after I had first asked them to arrange something. They were told by Patience that she wasn't in the office, and should call back on Monday the 28th. I went back to the shop again on the Monday just after lunch, to be told that a spare device should be arriving on Wednesday the 2nd March and that mine can then be booked in to sort out the faults. I went through to the shop at 15h00 yesterday, to be told that they still had not arrived with the spare phone as yet. Neatly 3 weeks, and there seems to be a don't care attitude from MTN about their customers and the difficulties they are experiencing. <br /><br />Problems that I have mentioned to them are as follows:<br />The phone continually loses signal down to zero. I will receive a notification of a voice mail without my phone even have rung.<br />During calls, the phone drops signal off, clients can barely hear me, and I have to then try and phone them back when the signal decides to return.<br />The phone will regularly just cut calls completely whilst I am on the phone with someone.<br />When I try and phone anyone, it takes ages before it decides to connect and start ringing.<br />On many occasions, when the phone does connect and ring when contacting someone, it sounds like a high-pitched robot sounding ring tone. Then if someone does happen to pick up, their voice sounds like a high-speed robot on helium. I then have to cancel the call either during it ringing, or when they answer, and then phone them back. This is extremely unprofessional as it appears like I am trying to give them a missed call to phone me back. The level of people I deal with in the mining industry, CEO's and CFO'S, this gives the impression that our company is on prepaid with giving missed calls. <br />If I try and watch some videos, the video is completely frozen, yet the sound is playing in the back ground. I have to double tap the screen to enlarge it before it actually plays.<br />When I try and put an address into google maps, it takes roughly 10 minutes to even find where I am and calculate the route. This is off my home Wi-Fi. <br />I have to have applications like email, LinkedIn, Microsoft teams on my phone for work purposes. If I go into them whilst I am out the office, I will get follow up notifications should I receive anything through any of these apps. If I am on my laptop, and an email or LinkedIn notification comes in, I generally swipe it off my screen as I can address it on my laptop. The phone will suddenly just stop sending notifications to me for no reason at all. I will have clients phoning me if I am out the office, asking why I have not responded to their mails, when I have not even been notified of it. <br />If there are occasions where I contact someone via Wattsapp call, I am told that I either sound like I am on the toilet with the extreme hollow sound, Or like I am the robot that has taken helium with how my voice sounds.<br />When I was at the MTN shop on Monday, I made mention that I am now so frustrated with the phone, and the fact that it is starting to make my work look unprofessional, that I will even give them the choice of which wall in their shop I will throw the phone through. They took this as a joke. The sad part, is I was dead serious with how highly irritated I am with the phone, and the fact that the service is actually beyond pathetic. This is all a bad reflection on MTN as a group!<br /><br />I would like to know how this issue will be resolved, and how long exactly it will take to rectify it? I should've stayed with my gut instinct and remained with Samsung as I always have, instead of being told otherwise. <br /><br />I await your speedy response with regards to this well overdue, and extremely frustrating and **** poor level of service I am currently receiving. |\n",

I'm still waiting for a response.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!! They are worse than Eskom, seriously. At least Eskom gives you electricity more times than they load shed. This company is the epitome of, how NOT to run a business.<br /><br />I would cancel, however, reading some of the other comments in this thread, I'll just put a stop-order on my account and they can come and fetch their useless router if they even get to phone me. Personal experience so far ... I'm thinking I'll sit with this router for a long long time... Fair enough, I'll have no internet due to the stop-order but they can come and fetch their router as I had to fetch when I ordered it. |\n",

       "| 2022-02-15 15:20:06 | Vodacom | Incompetent as can be | Dear Vodacom,<br /><br />Where oh where do I start with you guys?<br /><br />Here I am, yet again, dissatisfied by the customer service received and the continuous back and forth because Vodacom just does not care. <br /><br />I have been dealing with Vodacom since 01 February 2022 and its now the 15th and my issue is still not resolved. <br /><br />On 01/02/2022 a service request was logged and was given a turnaround time of 24-48 hours. No feedback given as advised by the representative. <br />On 04/02/2022 I spoke to an agent named Leena who was helpful and advised me that there was an issue at the base station that was affecting my fiber however it was coming up slowly area by arear. <br />She further advised me that the ticket logged on 01/02/202 was closed on 04/01/2022 by a person named Lebz Mgabashe who said they spoke to account holder and advised everything was up. This is utter bull**** as there was not a single form of communication made to the account holder. <br />On 11/02/2022 I reached my point with you people. I spent more than 3 hours on call with Vodacom to get something as simple as damn login details for my router and had no joy in having this provided to me. (Not surprising at all!) I spent 25 minutes on a call and that call dropped and dear Ntsoaki did not bother to call back. I called back, spent another 22 minutes with Ntokozo who also “dropped the call” and did not bother to call back. <br />On 15/02/2022, all I asked from Chumisa was to check if there has been any feedback regarding the ticket that was logged on 11/02/2022 , to which she replied that an email was sent to the account holders address. This was not the case as there was no email sent. I requested for her to forward that email to me and she said she could not trace it. After 35 minutes of trying to resolve my matter, she says she found the email. <br /><br />Based off this lovely short story above, do you understand my level of frustration? Do you understand how much time I have wasted with incompetent people from Vodacom? Do you understand that all this time I am wasting trying to give some kind of knowledge to the people I speak with is now back logging me from my work. Some of them are downright rude and obnoxious and start giving you attitude. <br />Every single time, without fail, I have to bring the roof down in the office to get my point across and it really is not fair for me to put my colleagues through negativity because of Vodacom. <br /><br />I’ve even spoken to someone from head office who had no idea of the process and procedures followed, who lacks understanding and can’t tell his ass from his elbow.<br /><br />I dread calling for assistance from Vodacom every time there’s an issue because I know my day is going to get ruined trying to get a simple query out of people who do the bare minimum and just rock up to do their job to get a salary. <br /><br />Vodacom literally has the account holder wanting to stop dealing with you guys and go to another service provider who has less drama and a little more knowledgeable service consultants. <br />We have been a customer with Vodacom well over 10 years and it seems each time I call for assistance, it keeps getting worse and worse, Tobi the chat bot is better at getting things done! I’m appalled by such service from such a reputed company. Please do not say that you as Vodacom can do such things knowing full well that it is impossible for your personnel to do. <br />I trust this email does not go in vain and some corrective action is taken regarding the aforementioned because if this email does go in vain, Vodacom can say goodbye to its loyal customers. No loyal customer enjoys such putrid customer service. |\n",

       "| 2022-02-08 10:40:54 | Telkom | I want to cancel my contract with Telkom if no solution to my problem and I am NOT willing to pay cancellation fees! | I have a big problem with Telkom! As from November 2021, I noticed that my router periodically loses internet access. I would see on my mobile devices that it says “connected without internet”. And this started slowly but to this day it is a daily problem! I called Telkom on 12th January 2022 to explain the situation and after a couple of attempts (speaking to useless and no-knowledge service champions) I spoke to someone who seemed informed enough. After that call I received a case number (**********2). On Friday 21st January I received an sms that my case was resolved, and while I was reading that text, I still sat with the “connected without internet” problem. At least once a day, this happens for 2 or more hours. This past Friday, there was no internet all day and even on Sunday the devices still said “connected without internet” for over 6 hours. I called Telkom on Sunday morning (to enquire about cancelling my contract with them) and spoke to Thandisile Msawuli (email address: ***********) who was brilliant and explained to me that I would need to pay over R1200 cancellation fee. But why should I pay such a fee when I am getting a bad service from the company? All it takes is to get a Tech person to come to the area and assess the situation, instead once you call Telkom you get a case number and few days later they tell you your case has been resolved. I then went to the Telkom store in Liberty Promenade and explained to the lady (exactly the words of the telephone consultant) that LTE has a weak signal in my area (i.e. Mandalay) and that I would like to migrate to All Net. She told me I CANNOT perform a migration from LTE to All Net. She took down my number and said someone would call me to assess the situation either that day or Monday, and today is Tuesday and no one has called me. She refused to take down my name. I want to cancel my contract with Telkom if everything has turned robotic and that no one is willing to come to the ground to assess the situation. And I am not prepared to pay a cancellation fee because I always pay on time, never been chased for payment! I work from home and this is inconvenient to always be unavailable for over 2 hours every single day! |\n",

The SMS doesn’t include a stop or opt out option - which is a  contravention of the POPI Act in itself. After 8 weeks of complaints via Facebook, Messenger, email and via their website (all ignored) I appear to have some kind of contact with either a bot or a person who responds like a bot! They’ve been telling me for the past week to change the emergency alerts setting on my phone (which I can’t find) or the cell broadcast setting (can’t find that either) so now they’re telling me to contact Apple for help. Surely the onus isn’t on me to block them by changing my settings? They’re spamming me a dozen times a day and seriously stressing me out.

The consultant also said to top it up Vodacom will give me 20GB for my tablet and 20GB for the pocket router which they couriered. Keeping in mind that their calls are recorded I kept on asking the consultant if I will be paying extra for this and she assured me that this comes at NO EXTRA costs.. I also did not agree to the disclosures she read to me as they sounded like a contract agreement (listen to the call). A week later I got a random debit order of R35 from Vodacom and this morning I received a statement which reflects an additional contract of R199. I called the customer care to query this and they advised that Mondo actioned the above and I should call them to cancel as I was deceived. This is concerning that Vodacom shared my details with another company and let them deduct my account without my concern. Anyway, I called Mondo and spoke to Glora who advised that all their systems are down and can’t access anything and gave me this reference number 123LM3M which I doubt its legit. I asked Glora to get their Team Leader or manager to give me a call as I wanted to lay a complaint against the consultant that misled me and she advised that I should expect it in an hour. 6 hours later still nothing from them so I called again and got through to Trisha( apologies if I got the spelling incorrect) who said she can’t help me as their systems are down and I must waste my airtime and time to call them again. I asked to speak to her manager and she said she’s transferring me but I think she put me on hold instead as I waited on the line for more than 11 minutes waiting for the manager to pick up the phone and eventually someone dropped my call.

This resulted in a number of other attempts to access other relationships I hold by the parties who conducted the fraudulent upgrades. Sim swaps and fraudulent upgrades occur, that I understand does happen. However when you paint your company as a technology company that is nothing without humanity, you then cannot remove humanity from your organisation and leave your customers to fend entirely for themselves.<br /><br />There is a not a human employee of Vodacom that you can talk to find out why your account is blocked, how a fraudulent transaction was carried out and when your services will be reconnected as everything channels through Tobi the chatbot who is able to sell you more airtime or upgrade a phone but fraud ... no can do.<br /><br />All staff in the stores are franchise staff, who face the same challenges as the consumer, so again no easy fix and they are largely helpless unless you need airtime or an upgrade. <br /><br />Speaking of upgrades, short of providing a DNA swap I get asked for all kinds of supporting documents when upgrading mobile phones in pursuit of RICA, FICA and other regulatory requirements. So my only conclusion is that there is some form of syndicate operating within Vodacom to enable this activity without the same level of due diligence taking place. <br /><br />My question to Vodacom is why focus so much getting customers into you ecosystem if you have no plans to support them once they are in it. I have been a customer for 20 years (not loyal, just easier not to change to another provider that is as bad as yourselves) and have grown to dislike the company intensely - not because I feel I am overcharged (although I am) or because I constantly drop calls (which I do) but because when I need assistance to resolve issues there is no one to assist adequately or timeously. <br /><br />Be better |\n",

I do not want to have my signature on Vodacom’s email system as I do no longer deal with the company, nor care to deal with them in the future as fraud is rife in this company, evident from all the complaints on Hello Peter.<br />I have also requested to see the mandate, but nothing was ignored. They have no respect for people who have been robbed by the company, things have to be done their way or the highway apparently! <br />LET ME BE CLEAR, I DO NOT TRUST VODACOM! Why do you want my signature before confirming if the account is on my name!!! Who knows what other nefarious activities you can do with my signature, and furthermore, the agent that is dealing with the case does not give out their full name, so how can you ever trust them?<br />I firmly believe my details were acquired from Vodacom’s very own database as I was a contract customer over a decade ago, which means, they already have my signature! If I had to guess, their employees are probably re-using old details to hand out contracts to others, that’s how they by passed Debi check!<br />What gives this company the rights to demand my signature if I am not their customer?!? They are withdrawing my money fraudulently, and do not even care to stop it! I have provided my cell number which can be RICA verified, my ID, and offered to provide my bank statement. They can FaceTime or call me to verify my identify! If this is on my name, confirm it, then I will provide my signature, but don’t ask me for my signature before you confirm if it is on my name!!!!!!!<br />They are causing me undue stress in my life! I have to send an email each month and check on my bill to see if I have been charged. This costs me time, and data! Vodacom are stealing time away from my life and you must pay for that. I want compensation for my time, stress experienced and all my bank fees! My next step is to lay criminal charges against Vodacom and contact the ombudsmen about how Vodacom has handled this situation! |\n",

A few months in I am still getting debit orders deducted from my account.

Because of their size and market dominance, they are high and mighty enough to fob you off and dismiss your claims, as nonsense and simply indicate that the matter has been resolved, for all the world to see. If you have an issue, for instance, my issue was that I wished to upgrade my Vodacom Internet data from an existing contract to the new one that I applied for on Black Friday,as the deal was too good to pass up. Despite my provision of evidence that I applied for the upgrade and that I was well within the time frames of the promotion, Vodacom decided that I did not qualify for the upgrade and that the system had rated me on a low scale- Obviously, this is not true but merely fabricated, as I have never missed a single payment on my account, and was willing to forward them a bank statement for the past two years to prove my case. All this is, including this complaint is in vain, as the team in charge of sorting out these matters or complaints, simply states that the matter has been resolved, so the public see that they supposedly resolved issues, but do absolutely nothing in addressing them. You are dealing with scammers, who falsely advertise deals and then when you have fallen for the bait, refuse to honor the deals they advertise. BE CAREFUL!! You the customer will have absolutely no one to assist you should you have a query that requires resolve. You can try to phone all the numbers that are advertised on the net, all you'll get is a robot, and when you do eventually speak to a human, they will not be able to sort out your problems. All the staff will do is escalate the problems and you will receive an email within 24 hours to say that the matter has been successfully resolved, whilst knowing full well that they have done absolutely nothing. Find a network that will treat the customer fairly and resolve issues, stay away from Vodacom, as I promise you, you will have endless hassles, that will remain unresolved for the duration of your contract. My hope is that people will wise up, wake up and start treating these companies like Vodacom that take their customers for granted with the same disdain they use in their resolve of issues of their customers. |\n",

He was told to phone the cancellation number, which he duly did.  He was assured by Vodacom that the last debit order would be at the end of June 2021.  He stipulated that two of the numbers were to remain under his name as Pay as You Go.<br /><br />Here we are in December, and surprise, surp[rise, the debit order for all three contracts are still going through.<br /><br />Since my brother is bot in South Africa, he asked me to follow up with his cancellation.<br /><br />I phoned the cancellation Department, and was told that since I was a third party that they could not help me.  In order for me to do the follow up, they would need a Power of Attorney from my brother giving them permission to liaise with me about these contracts, as well as a copy of his ID.  They gave me the e-mail address to which he should send the e-mail with the required attachments.<br /><br />This was done on 5 Deem her 2021.  When I phoned the cancellation Department on 6 December, I was informed that they had not yet received the e-mail.  I double-checked the e-mail address, and it was sent to the correct address.  Since my brother had cc'd me ion on the mail to Vodacom, I forwarded the mail I had received to them.<br /><br />When I phoned them on 15 December 2021, I was told that they had not received either mail.  This is 10 days after the first mail was sent to them.  I was told that they get thousands of mails every day.  I was then told that the best thing to do was to go into a Vodacom Store with the Power of Attorney from my brother and I would be helped, as well as a request would be put I for a full refund from July 2021 to date.<br /><br />I went to two Vodacom Stores on 16 December, and neither store could help me, as the cancellations have to be done telephonically.<br /><br />I have tried everything possible to get these contracts cancelled, but Vodacom is not at all helpful.  I cannot believe that 10 days after e-mails are sent, they have not yet been received.<br /><br />Sadly, Vodacom, although being a corporate Company, is totally incompetent to help any customer, unless there is a sale involved, where they would be falling over themselves to assist the customer.<br /><br />How else can a contact be cancelled?  we have tried telephonically, by e-mail, going into the store, but nothing works. |\n",

After waiting an hour to be assisted, he was finally helped by Rico, an unsupervised trainee.  My husband had to fill in two sets of documents and then was told that the upgrade was complete.  Rico went to get his new phone and then told him that no, he cannot take the phone - after all the paperwork etc had been completed.  No valid reason as to why he could not take the phone was given.  Matter was discussed with the store Supervisor, Wandile - and still not resolved or proper explanation given.  My husband then proceeded to upgrade another number that he has online - this was done on Monday, we received the email to confirm the order, and to date no phone has arrived.  Vodacom online also stated that he could upgrade his current line, the one that he wanted to upgrade in store, and he proceeded to once again do the upgrade procedure online - only to be told at check out that there were no deals available for him ... even though he had chosen the deal he wanted! Phoning Vodacom Customer Care proved useless.  The upgrade department told him that he had already received his new upgraded phone from Vodacom Westwood Mall!  The very same phone that Westwood Mall told him they could not give him. Another surprise was that it appeared a further upgrade was loaded and pending on the system - Rico the trainee at Vodacom Westwood Mall does not seem to know what he is doing - he has loaded two contracts now - and not even given one phone!.  Complaint was lodged with reference 1-**********9081 - sms received.  A short while later a further sms was received saying the ticket was closed and matter was resolved - no telephone calls or advices how the matter was resolved were received.  To date we still cannot proceed with the upgrade on line.<br />Telephone calls to Vodacom customer care are fruitless and interaction with Tobi the Bot System is pathetic.  The phone that was upgraded has still not been received.  Finally managed to get hold of Prudence in customer care who advised that the matter was with their back office for review and that there is a back log - however, an email and sms confirming the order has already been received.  Where in this world does someone have to wait more than three days for their new phone? in the past we have upgraded and the phone has been delivered even the following day!.  No one at Vodacom seems to want to help, and Covid is to blame for a lot of delays... convenient i would say.  Personnel at Westwood Mall also don't seem to care about their lack of service.

I'm convinced this is done deliberately to discourage consumers making more complaints.<br /><br />My piece of advice: before dealing with any business; work backwards. Call their customer lines and see how long you wait before you are helped, go on platforms like these and see how exisiting customers issues are handled. This will save you a lot of headache ahead. |\n",

I got an SMS to say my data connection has stopped and to contact Telkom. When I dialled 081180, I was sent to Whatsapp chat bot which gave list of options to press, none of which suited my issue. I dial 10210 with the same result being referred to Whatsapp Chat bot. Dialled 10213 which also has no option to query why my data has stopped. <br />This is extremely frustrating, why can I not get to talk to a Customer Service agent about data related issues? |\n",

The entire story was on Carte Blanche 3 months ago (I found out after doing research about the scam) so why do you allow allow scam to go on for this long and not do a thing about it???<br />Now they want me to pay R8000 which the scammed spent on my account after their systems aren't foolproof and anyone can clearly enter it!<br />I was called by a certain mister who calls himself Jason Oosthuizen. He claimed he was calling from MTN and someone tried to do a simswop on my account the morning, is this correct. I immediately said no, it's not. He said they'll block it and I need to send him the OTP that was sent to me from MTN's system. He then mentioned the name of the person wanting to do the simswop and asked if I knew anyone by that name, I said no. He also said the email address was changed to that person's email address and gave it to me. I again said no, that's not correct. He sent another OTP from MTN's system and said I must provide that so he can change it. Again I gave it and he gave me a reference number, his name and IP address (all fake obviously). Then the call just dropped. I got another sms to say my limit has been increased to over R9000 and then they started spending. I had to quickly search for the fraud department number and had to listed to the stupid robot talking while they are spending! Eventually I get to someone, hold for a long time until she says her system is frozen so she can't do anything and I need to call back. In the mean time, they're still spending. I call back, speak to someone else, he changes my limit and then the call drops again. I call again, speak to someone else, explain it all for a THIRD time! She then says MTN won't pay that and I'm liable for it since I gave the OTP. NO, I'm not liable for YOU securing your system and making sure it's foolproof! You can't expect clients to pay for your stupidity! Clearly your system is NOT SECURE as these hackers entered your system, sent OTP's from your system and even increased my limit, without me doing ANYTHING! So how the hell can you expect clients to pay because your system is NOT SECURE?????? We already pay you enough to have all your **** together but now we have to pay for you to be stupid as well?????<br />This is not right in any way and what makes it even worse, you don't give a **** and never bothered to do anything about the scam to stop it. So what does that mean? Obviously you're in on it too!!!! I am NOT paying for your insecure system and your debit order will be disputed! Even if I get a bad credit record, you will NOT benefit from your own scam! |\n",

       "| 2021-11-15 19:57:59 | MTN South Africa  | Re: MTN Sim swap complaint [#**********] | Good Day MTN South Africa <br /><br />I am writing this as a very disappointed and annoyed MTN client. Lost my phone with sim card on 06/11 and did a self service sim swap on 07/11 which was Sunday morning,  I answered correctly the questionare and got a confirmation sms to say sim swap is in progress should be completed in 2-24 hours. I later than day called the call center to blacklist my device I was however told I can't do that as it's after hours, cool I then asked to check the status of my sim swap and I was advised yes it's in progress I should wait until the following day. As the following came and the 24 hours lapsed I called again the call center only to be told that no my sim swap failed as I had dialed and used the sim cars of which it was utter nonsense as for the period from Sunday until Monday I was using a MrP sim card,  the agent then suggested that we do the sim swap tellephonically and I agreed as they said the questions will be the same,  to my surprise I was told I failed authentication ofwhich I didn't understand now because it was the same questions and answers as per the self service I did the previous day. I tried to speak to one of the TL's thinking it might help the situation but also with him it was as if I'm talking to a robot, no courtesy at all as I was quickly brushed off and refered to go instore with copy of certified ID and saps sworn affidavit.  Cool I quickly rushed and dodged work and went to the Westgate mall store only to be told when I got there that the new store manager's rule is that no sim swaps are to be done at that particular store,  I was utterly shocked to say the least. Cool as angry as I was I went on Thursday now 11/11 to the Randburg square MTN store only to get there I'm rudely told that number one they don't do sim swap at the store they just send the docs to the call center to process it, such bull disturbed me as I was expecting this to be my last resort, secondly I was told that the affidavit that I wrote was inconclusive(wow) how does an official saps signed and stamped document become inconclusive... while I was still outside the store I called the call center again and told them what had transpired, for a minute the agent seemed to understand until she asked me to give the lady at the store the phone  and I don't know what they said to each other that made it seem as if I was lying with everything I've been telling them or asking them to help me with.  To cut matters short I was dismissed without getting any assistance whatsoever,  flip I had to go back to the saps and re-write the affidavit.  Having to work long hours and having to do all of this was frustrating to say the least.  Cool Saturday (13/11) afternoon I managed to go to MTN Maponya mall to try again,  got there stood in the queue then boom we were told sim swap system is \"offline\" one of the personnel tried to give an excuse to say it's due to the looting in July most MTN subscribers now flock to the Maponya mall store in the turn the system is \"over flooded\" that's the wording the guy used,  we should come back the following day (Sunday) morning between 9-12 as that's when the system is up and running. Cool so me being me I wake up the following day being Sunday 14/11 crossing fingers now that the system is up and running since I did all that needed to be done from my side. I get to the store the same guy now tells me bull**** that one of the \"managers\" that are supposed to authorize sim swap is not I  for the day and thus I can't do the scanning of the docs however they can ask me questions if pass then they can do the sim swap,  of which it didn't and still doesn't make sense to me m***m.  Cool I agree to that however when I get to the counter I get a different story now to say they can't do the questions they'll have to scan the docs of which that's what I was expecting from the start,  Cool docs where seeminngly scanned and again I was told the TAT 2-24 hours, sharp.  It's Monday today I was advised that I will have to dial *123*888# to check the cellphone number,  I've been doing this since mid day and all I get is (service temporarily unavailable 503) when I called the call center today I was told that there isn't a Sim swap request showing for my number,  the last one was on 07/11... that left me flabbergasted to say the least.  Msooon WE MTN please help me with this sim swap maan ****it!!!! |\n",

I still don't know how or why I owed them this as they don't take clients seriously. I was a client for 8 years and they didn't even feel the need to give me the courtesy of a proper engagement. None of the questions I asked were answered. The cancellation process was delayed from their side to begin with. Still don't know how they gave me a last and final payment or they wouldn't let me port away. This was paid and my number was ported to great service provider  Telkom mobile. This was over a year ago. Then I find out I owe Cell C an amount from 6 months ago. How ? Anyway I decided to pay the amount to keep my sanity and at least I can then break my ties with Cell C who I will never do business with again and I tell my story to ally friends and family who ask my opinion on them of course.

       "| 2021-09-28 14:11:50 | Cell C | Credit theft at Cell C, the company itself! Don't believe it? Read this! | I have recently had one of many experiences of a sim card crash. This time it was my child's cell phone sim card, and there was around R300 credit on the sim, shared to him between my wife and I over time. After the sim <br /><br />crashed, we did not have the time to buy him a new sim and do a sim swop for a few months. When we finally found the time to buy a sim and do the sim swop for him, we were told that Cell C had in the meantime decided <br /><br />they will not only deactivate the sim (which they now claim was due to Rica policy), but that they will take back all his unused credit!<br /><br />I was shocked when the consultant told me with appology there's nothing they can do about it because it is company policy that once the sim is deactivated Cell C will take back all the credit we bought that is on that Sim, <br /><br />and that they cannot refund it or re-issue the credit once the sim is reactivated.<br /><br />Most Cell C agents (both at the stores and at the call center) do not know the procedure for reactivating permanently deactivated sims. Fortunately after making a big fuss a line manager at the call-center told me what to do, <br /><br />and when I went to the store itself I learnt further parts of the procedure, which I will now share in total as it might also help other customers:<br /><br />How to reactivate a permanently deactivated Sim:<br /><br />1. Obtain police Affidavit to say we wish to use the sim again which was deactivated due to extended period of inactivity.<br /><br />2. Visit a Cell C store. Ask the agent to call the TPHD department which will assist the store agent to reactivate the sim.<br />3. At this stage the TPHD department will require you to provide the store agent with the Rica user's ID, proof of residence and the affidavit you obtained from the police station. Once these have been captured, the store <br /><br />agent will perform a sim swop and you will have to discard the old sim even if it was not damaged, and you will have to pay R11 for a new sim.<br /><br />4. Remember Cell-C will steal any credit you had before the permanent deactivation took place and there's no way of getting it back.<br /><br />Another unscrupulous feature of Cell phone companies which I found out about is that by default, they activate a service on all user Sims, called Background services. This allows partner companies to subscribe you to <br /><br />music, games and other things they claim to offer, and charge you a premium fee which is quietly taken out from your airtime credit without you knowing.<br />You have to deactivate this nonsense otherwise your money can be lost.<br />Fortunately we can still deactivate this. The day may come when you probably won't even be able to do that too. I mean if they can activate this feature without you knowing, then in time they can take that further by <br /><br />preventing you from deactivating it too. As we know, this is human nature: if you can get away with one wrong deed by justifying it Etc, then you will try to take it further. So beware of this.<br /><br />With Cell C for now at least, you deactivate this background services feature using the following command from your phone's dialer:<br />*133*7422*.<br /><br />Finally one last useful tip:<br /><br />Cell C activates International roaming by default so you will pay huge international call charges, perhaps without realizing it when travelling.<br />You have to deactivate International Roaming if you do not want to lose your credit that way.<br /><br />To Opt out of International Roaming:<br />Dial *106*3# from your phone's dialer.<br /><br />I hope these tips will help some of you out there.<br /><br />Please remember that the call center agents are often helpless when companies make bad policies to exploit their customers. We consumers must find ways to tramp on the right toes to effect changes. Screaming at front-end <br /><br />customer agents is like shooting a messenger: You will get nowhere except to irritate the agent. They don't care about our threats because it doesn't affect them personally, so don't waste your time.<br /><br />We have to think up ways of reaching the company investors. We must create an awareness big enough that investors will be forced to put pressure on policy makers in the business. I believe fantastic platforms like <br /><br />Hellopeter can play a major role in this.<br /><br />If anyone has any thoughts on this, let's talk. You can write me on ykhandoo followed by the At sign followed by webmail dot co dot za. I have masked this E-mail address to prevent spam robots. Once I have talked to <br /><br />some of you I can set up a conference where we can discuss together for those interested.<br />The conference will be a general discussion on how to impact bad business practices from any large corporation by tramping the right toes to get the right things done. I think it will be an interesting discussion so do write to <br /><br />me and share ideas. We will all probably learn a lot this way.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Yogan Khandoo |\n",

They all say I must phone ********** to cancel. Fine! I swallowed my pride and phone the damn number. It's not even a human being on the phone. It's an automated robot that keeps insisting I upgrade. It speaks slow and only provides the option to cancel at the very end. After being extremely patient and followed procedure, I still don't receive confirmation of my cancelation. I still get ads to upgrade.<br /><br />I'm from a branch at Springsmall today. The employees there not only refused to cancel my contract, they admitted that vodacom management wants them to insist I phone that stupid number that does not work.

In the past, before there were all these different data and smart phone option, Vodacom used to issue an additional contract and number for the data routers.

However, because I now subscribe to a 5G network, I have no need for the continuation of this specific number and have been trying to instruct Vodacom cancel my data number and contract.  This, however seems an impossible task.  I have tried a Vodadcom Shop, they referred me to the number 082 135 and **********.  Following the voice prompts, you seem to go in circles.

I have called, emailed etc. Have also emailed asking for contact details of a supervisor or manager but have had no response. <br />A simple admin error has now become a major source of frustration<br />#WIN<br />I do not want them to take the new contact phone back I just want them to allocate it to the correct cell number under my contract.<br /><br />I seem to have exhausted all avenues as the response to my previous postings was that I would be contacted and prior to that they would collect the upgrade and resolve the issue. Has unfortunately not happened. I want to complain to ICSA but unfortunately the complaint has to be escalated at Vodacom before I can contact them.  This was done and closed before the issue was resolved<br /><br />CAN YOU HELP HELLOPETER? <br /><br />Many thanks |\n",

They are billing customers for something they never signed up for, and not even letting the customer know that there is an active service that they are being billed for, until your airtime is gone & then only if you query it do you find they have signed you up for something you never requested or consented to.<br />I ant to see proof of when I signed up for this service that they are billing me for, as I never clicked on any links or signed up anywhere for this. I do not even receive sms's or any product or service for this supposed APPSUP.<br />What the heck is APPSUP, and what are you paying for.<br />This should be investigated by authorities, as this is happening all too easy & Vodacom just makes it your problem, and charges you money without having to ever prove that you even signed up for his rubbish.<br />I want my money back that was shamelessly stolen from me, unless Vodacom can prove to me where I signed up for this ****.<br />I am sure there are many many more people that they steal from in t his manner! |\n",

After being transferred back and forth and being told to call different numbers, one agent transferred me to another agent at 13:26 who assisted me and advised that my query will be logged and resolved in the next 72 hours- Friday, 30 June 2021. The reference number I received for this query was S*******-****01. <br /> <br />I allowed a period of two days to pass and called in just to check the status of my query, in hopes that it would be done earlier than expected. I spoke to a lady  who said that Vodacom was still working on my query and she was going to send IT an email and call back with feedback, it’s now 02 August 2021 and I’m still waiting for her to call back. <br /> <br />I called in once more because it seems Vodacom’s support center is incompetent of giving feedback to clients let alone keeping to their word. I say this because I called in today, 02 August 2021, and spoke to another agent. I gave him my reference number for my query and he tells me that my query has been complete and resolved. Due to this being an IT matter, I called my IT support team and they advised that the port forwarding has not been done. <br /> <br />You can guess what I did next; I called Vodacom customer support once again! This time I spoke to a more knowledgeable person who advised that an email was sent and the It department closed the ticket. No feedback was given, not even a simple phone call to say that they could not do the port forwarding, here’s access to the router please have your IT guys to sort it out. <br /> <br />Keep in mind, the initial agreement was to have the ports forwarded on Vodacom’s end and it would take 72 hours, that’s 3 business days. I have now lost 3 business days thanks to the incompetent personnel that Vodacom chooses to hire. There is no point in saying calls are recorded for quality and training purposes when the customer support desk or should I say the IT department , has no idea what they’re doing. <br /> <br />I have been a customer with Vodacom well over 10 years and it seems each time I call for assistance, it keeps getting worse and worse, Tobi the chat bot is better at getting things done!

I would also like to understand how the very same Vodacom App states that 2 Gig is \"used\" in my total availability of data, but when you go to the Calendar Custom data - it states that 21.13MG has been used in 2 days.  Is it then at all possible to trust their Vodacom App to declare that the data usage is correct?  On a normal working day, with Youtube Videos, I myself do not use 500 MG, How does 7 Gig just drop in a house where no kids has access to the data by themselves, and only 2 phones are connected - without upgrades done.  My data daily drops up to 2 gig, but I use other Wifi as well - while my personal data is turned off.  I find it criminal that a company's own App states 2 different statuses of data usage.  I've spoken to Vodacom via Messenger, and the very same \"robotic\" answers are being repeated.  I'm being reverted to a technician but the funny thing is that the technician tells me that all their customers who deals via Vodacom are unhappy and has all Data trouble, Server Setting issues.  I'm expected to change my server settings every time I use Data via Vodacom and another provider. My request to Vodacom is this:  Hand me an App that shows me exactly where my data is going.  You provide my data - but you can not show me where my data is going, yet, you expect me to pay you for data, so that my data can be \"lost\" / untraced.  Vodacom; Man-up to your service.  My car is more effective than you since it CAN tell me how many kms I've done and how many kms to the litre I get.  I've never had trouble with Vodacom, all of a sudden it's ridiculous.

But to put a cherry on top of their rotten service, they say I cannot lodge a complaint. My debit order date is the 5th of every month. On the 5th of April Telkom did not debit my account. There was sufficient funds in the account. Therefore, it was not a bounce. And if it was a bounce, the bank would have notified me of the bounce and would have charged me. I called the contact centre and I was informed that Telkom did not collect the money due to a system error. During that time, I did not receive any notification from Telkom or any type of communication indicating that the account was in arrears.<br /><br />I had service for the duration of April but in May I realised that I had no internet connection. I thought there was something wrong with either the router or sim card because I was unaware that the money was not collect. On the 25th of May, I inserted the sim card in my phone and it is only then that I learned my line has been suspended. And when I called, I learned that indeed it was suspended due to non-payment. As a result of Telkom having failed to collect the money.<br /><br />I am unhappy because:<br />1.\tTelkom did not inform me that the account was in arrears. There was no communication non whatsoever. They usually send an SMS with the banking details if the account is in arrears a week or two later but there was no such this time around.<br />2.\tI am required to pay a lump sum of R1,932 including the June debit order. I do not have a lump sum.<br />3.\tI am willing to make a payment arrangement provided the line is reinstated since it was a non-performance issue on their side. Telkom did not do its part as service provider. I don’t understand why the line should remain suspended when I am willing to make a payment arrangement. This would mean I am not getting a service at all yet, I should pay for data that I am not using. If I am going to lose all of May's data which I have not used, then why should I pay for May?<br />4.\tFurthermore, if the line remains suspended until I pay off these arrears, will I accumulate the data that I have not used for the months in question because if the data will not accumulate, it does not make sense to pay for a service that was suspended and for data that I have not used and will never use.<br /><br />If Telkom insists that I pay the lump sum arrears first before reinstating the account, then I would like to cancel this subscription. Immediately. I will pay the cancellation fee of R807. So that no further amounts accrue and then I can make an arrangement to settle the arrears.<br /><br />I hope Telkom will have the decency to respond to this because, really, their customer care service is rotten. Their contact centre agents are programmed like robots. All they say is \"pay the outstanding. Then you line will be reactivated\"<br /><br /><br /> |\n",

She said i had called in April and changed the adress. That is a load of ****, i received a call  a few months ago from your staff member stating that i was eligible for an upgrade and i said i will not be upgrading my contract. I did not call in to change an address, this was done by your criminal staff member who saw an opportunity but my question is, what type of processes do you have at telkom that allow sensitive information like 'postal address' to be changed telephonically, should this not be done at the branch????I really warn anyone who have an existing contract that is about to end, to ensure they follow up that TELKOM STAFF does not upgrade their contract without their consent and send the phones to their friends. Furthermore there is no security at all at Telkom, what authentication process was done when this phone was delivered to the fraudster??? I have never lost my ID so how did the delivery man authenticate this person?? <br />Our private information is not safe at all with Telkom. I warn the public. <br />Anyway I was told by this call agent  to send an affivadit, my proof of adress and copy of ID to the complaints department @ ***********.

I told the call centre agent about it, and asked him if I was still paying for something I wasn't using, he then referred me to the cancellation department, who then said no I can't cancel the contract because it is a two-year contract, after which I said, but I never gave permission to continue with the contract.  I have been paying for something I am not using, I even told him that he can go look on the ****le history and see that I haven't been using it because I thought it was cancelled.  He then gave me some sort of weird (I only found out afterwards that it's not a proper reference number) reference number and said it would take 2 to 3 working days to resolve.  It's more than 14 working days later and I have still heard nothing from them.  And when I call the customer care line they send me from one to the other to the other person.

The following day the phone lines were CUT ONCE AGAIN! I called Vodacom and they said that my account was 23c in arrears... So they just cut my phones off without any notification. I was not informed of the outstanding R0.23 on my account... so I paid this immediately. 3 days later it was turn of the month and once again my phones were cut, I called the number and was informed I owed R4600 from the last bill.. they just cut me without any warning.. I paid this last night. I had to leave for Cape Town (3 hour drive) at 5am and by then the phones were still not on. I was basically driving without any communication. on my way the car started to breakdown whilst I was on the phone with the operator. The lights were flashing on and off and all electronics were rapidly switching on and off as well as the cat cutting out. I asked him to please put the phone back on as I still had to get to Cape Town and my life was at risk if I was unable to communicate on the phone. He said that he can do nothing and the computer switches on and off automatically and although he understood my situation there was NOTHING he could do.. I managed to settle the car down and made it to Cape Town safely but had an extremely anxious drive past townships and high danger areas on the N2. It was an extremely stressful journey and I prayed all the way that the car would not break down and I was blessed with no more mechanical problems during the journey. <br /><br />Basically I pleaded to the operator for my safety and he said he could not do anything. I am done with Vodacom!!! I have had contracts for the last 15 years and never defaulted on my obligation but when you need their help all they say is that they cannot help as the system is computer driven...<br /><br />Vodacom needs to look at this seriously as I may have been killed this morning if broken down in the wrong area. They put my life at risk and the risk of my 2 daughters losing their father. It is simply just disgusting! The human factor must be brought back into the business instead of robotic operators not having the power or will to go out of their way to assist customers. <br /><br /> |\n",

Now this new one doesnt connect at all even though it should connect both 4G and 5G. I have reset the router, moved it on all corners of the house, still no connection.

       "| 2021-04-19 08:45:12 | Vodacom | VODACOM DISAPPOINTS YET AGAIN WITH TOBI APP NOT WORKING??? | On 7 April at 07:26 I made a phone call to ********** and was directed to customer care because the collections dept only opens at 08:00.  The reason for me calling this time is because I drive about 30 mins to work and wanted to to this before I get busy at work.  I spoke to a client services consultant and informed her that I wanted to make a payment arrangement as I only got half of my salary this month.  She took all details and made the arrangement,  I did not ask her name, but she said that she has escalated the query to the collections department and that they will contact me.  On 8 April I got a link to use \"Tobi\" on which I once again logged a \"promise to pay\" although I captured it for 3 months - I meant only for this month - but my point I am trying to make is that it was captured.  On Friday, 16 April my lines were disconnected.  I called the collections department and the lady who answered told me that if I give her the reference number of the call made to client services she will assist me.  On checking my messages I found that I did not receive a sms with the reference number.  I then told her but I capture a promise to pay on the Tobi app whereby she informed me \"that does not count\"?????  So why waste my data on the Tobi whatsapp app if it doesnt mean anything?? She had a bad attitude and didnt even try to assist me.  When I told her that I did call on the 7th she just simply said - proof it.  I then called the cancellations department because I am furious with Vodacom.  I truly have a problem to make payment, I do all I can to make an arrangement, someone at customer care does not do their job, Tobi is a non-working app and my lines get disconnected.  I was then informed by the person there that I should request the call recording as proof that I called on the 7th.  (This is service).  So I called customer care and requested the recording of the 7th of April to prove that I did make the call and that the customer care consultant didnt capture it on the system.  Then I called the collections department to tell them to listen to the recording as proof that I did indeed make the arrangement and that some incapable person didnt do their job and now I am being \"punished\" for it.  The consultant told me that he will refer it to his supervisor and they will call before 17:00 to give me feedback.  This didnt happen.  I have been a customer of Vodacom for many years.  I have in the past made payment arrangements and this is now the second time they disconnect my lines after I made arrangements.  My wish is to cancel this contract asap because the one time I truly have a problem I am not assisted or listened to.  VODACOM JUST DISAPPOINTS!!  Customer Care and Collections services SUCKS!! |\n",

I've followed the necessary measures provided by Vodacom to rectify the issue but nothing works. <br /><br />I've been to a branch, they didn't help at all besides logging a reference ticket.<br /><br />I phoned the call centre. Their call centre agent assured me the issue would be fixed after they \"fixed it on their end\", but was unable to tell me what exactly the fix does. Needless to say, I ended the call and restarted my phone - it didn't work.

Stop talking it \"AI\", it's not.<br /><br />The \"talk to agent online\" feature is basically non-existent on their help portal. I get it, you want to reduce call volumes and get people to fix their own issues instead. But then don't advertise it in all your correspondence and provide hyperlinks for it.<br /><br />I've probably sent about 6 emails now, each response is essentially useless, and things I've already tried (and informed them of).

       "| 2021-03-11 12:08:12 | Vodacom | Vodacom Customer Care | After listening to the automated menu on your customer care line far too many times and trying to wait it out for the consultant on nearly every menu option mostly unrelated to the issue I wanted to solve, I FINALLY managed to get through to a consultant who was very helpful. I can't even remember during which part of the menu I was finally offered the option to hold for a consultant because your customer care line keeps trying to divert to your \"self-help\" bot \"Tobi\".<br /><br />Suggestions from a customer if you do not want to lose customers in future:<br /><br />1. If you want people to use the bot, that's all good and well, but make sure it at least works before you place it in your call menu. <br /><br />2. After going through nearly your entire call menu to get to a consultant, I can at least let you know, your \"Tobi\" bot only \"works\" on SMS, not WhatsApp. Even if you select the WhatsApp option. I can also tell you, typing \"menu\" as instructed after the bot texts, does not work. Typing ANY word relating to possible Vodacom issues such as \"account\", \"billing\", \"cancellations\" (I can go on), does not work. An annoying message just pops up saying the bot cannot help me with this, please dial 082 135. The sad reality is that customer care number sent me to the bot more times than I can count. <br /><br />3. Another area that needs fixing is getting into my account online. Once I have a set fee for a year or more, I don't go into my account online. Therefore I can never seem to remember the password I use the random time a couple years ago that I wanted to check when my contract is due for an upgrade. If I click \"forgot password\", it sends me an OTP. Which is all good and well, that works. However, when they send a new password for you to use, even after 1 min, 1 hour, 1 day. It will never work. So I cannot get into MY Vodacom account, FORCING me to phone customer care, which is pretty much FORCING me to use the broken bot.<br /><br />4. After finally reaching a very helpful consultant which is all I was looking for in the first place and they asked me to rate their service, you give an option to give them a 10 for very satisfactory. However, every time I typed 10, it said I gave the consultant a 1, and asked if I meant to give them a 1. Why ask to rate a 10 if a person can't give a 10 rating? Why not just make 9 the highest rating?<br /><br />I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I had to spend at least 2 hours of my time trying to get into my account online and phoning customer care to speak to a consultant to finally fix such a small issue. Fortunately for you, I'm quite patient, but I'm definitely not happy with having to try so many different avenues which is what took up my time. I can tell you now, there are many customers out there that would never have put up with this. The punchline, I just wanted to find out why my account was so high last month because for some reason I didn't receive an invoice for last month when I moved from a normal cell phone contract to only a data contract.  <br /><br />On a positive note, while I was trying to access a consultant, I eventually had an idea to contact you on FB messenger. I received a reply within 5 minutes. Unfortunately, it came through just after a consultant answered the phone and helped me. I wish I had thought of taking that route first as I could have had 2 hours of my life to do something more useful and I wouldn't have written this poor review.<br /><br />By the way, I would have given you a rating of 1 but seeing as your actual consultants are polite and willing to help I raised it to 2. |\n",

Recently, my phone stopped receiving text messages, and then also calls. On Sunday I took the phone into a Vodacom centre in Somerset West, and was told that I needed to phone the Customer Call Centre, but that I should avoid speaking to the Robot, as it would not be able to help me. The Robot proved impossible to avoid, but gave me no assistance whatsoever, including because it wanted me to respond to SMSs, whereas part of my problem was precisely that I wasn't receiving SMSs. I then emailed Customer Care to see if I could receive assistance. After multiple emails, my phone/sim was synchronized, but to no apparent effect. I was advised to try my sim in another phone, and it didn't work in that, as I reported back to Vodacom by email. I assume the sim itself is faulty? The reference number I was given was A9-NNC8-LIRS.  But five days after my first approach to Vodacom, I still can't receive calls or SMSs, which is making working, banking, or social interaction extremely difficult. This is really shockingly bad service. My cell no is **********, but that information is largely academic, as I can't receive calls except for WhatsApp calls.

Being a technical person I asked for error codes or what the diagnostic output was, and they couldn't provide me that other than the quote and saying they dont deal with the error codes. I don't know why I need to pay for a repair on the phone if its within the contract and it wasn't due to negligence. I then asked the agent if I could pay the existing 8 months and get a new contract but they said they unable to do this and its the Vodacom policy and openly admitted this is how they get users to sign up for a new contract. Not the smartest way to retain business. UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!!!!! |\n",
       "| 2021-03-08 11:41:58 | MTN South Africa  | MTN Customer Service Sucks | Hello<br /><br />I have been struggling for quite some time with MTN cutsomer service, both while still having contract and after it.<br /><br />End of 2019 December I opened a contract for R200 pm 10G Day time and 10G nite time (it was a special at the time). Not long after I had the contract I had a sudden notification that the price would increase, resulting my contract being R250 pm and it being only 6 months after I signed my contract with them.<br /><br />Later on I no longer had signal at home and if there was it was one WhatsApp maybe every 2 hours I received, absolutely terrible signal. I logged numerious complaints... only after 3 months they finally decided they had enough of my every day calls about the complaint. Installed a receiver and a router for me for free.<br /><br />Not long after this my contract was due to expire soon. The app just showing me I can upgrade and not when at all. <br /><br />In December of 2020 I noticed my debit order was suddelnly R247 and I didn't think much of it. I went to an MTN shop to query my contract expiration date and they informed me it had already expired in November 2020. They gave me my reference number and told me to phone 135.<br /><br />This is where the customer service after contract expiry gets worse and worse.<br /><br />After calling 135 a bunch of times, being on hold for hours in conclusion the call ended while I was on hold for more than a hour. I tried again the next day being frustrated and the robotic voice told me 135 was no longer a MTN number but now a Cell C number and the call ended. <br /><br />Serching website after website for an alternative number, I finally decided to send an email to customer service (***********) and they adviced me to send my complaint to ***********. <br /><br />After doing so all I got was a reference number and I haven't heard a word again. It has been 3 months since the incident and the debit order keeps deduction itself from my bank all when I've been trying to cancel the forsaken thing. <br /><br />I have even asked my bank if they could stop it, but informed me they cannot because the reference number keeps changing. Resulting in a new debit cancellatoin each month. Since then I have been reversing the debit order monthly manually. Hoping that THEY WOULD CALL ME. <br /><br />Inserted real emails between me and customer care:<br /> <br />12/01/2021<br />Message:\tYour number 135 is no longer working, it is Cell C. The entire last week you were offline when I phoned to cancel my contract. Please contact me asap.<br /><br />12/01/2021<br />Good day Clarissa,<br />Thank you for your email. <br />We apologize for the delayed response.<br /> Kindly be advised that your query has been escalated to retentions department for further assistance and they will revert to you as soon as they done with your request <br />We look forward to being of service to you.<br /><br />25/01/2021<br />Good Morning<br /> I haven’t heard any response as of yet.<br /> I reversed the debit order, because I no longer want MTN services, please help me asap.The longer the response takes the more your company is proving to me that customer service is of no importance.<br /> This is a problem I’ve had with MTN since I got my contract and it is very unpleasant.<br /> Thank you<br /> <br />01/02/2021<br />Good day Clarissa,<br />Thank you for your request. <br />We apologise for the inconvenience and delays caused.<br />Kindly email the retentions department on *********** for further assistance.<br />Kind Regards,<br />Boipelo Phiri<br />MTN SA<br />Reference Number: ********** <br /><br />Me to Retentions:<br />01/02/2021<br />Good Afternoon<br />I wish to end my contract. No one is helping me as quickly as I had hoped, or at all.<br />Find attached previous emails.<br />Kind Regards<br /><br /><br />In short, they have absolutely the worst customer service.  |\n",

Instead of trying to resolve the probleems you get passed around. Where have you seen a business who is given an opportunity of growth turn away clients. Have been trying to get additional paid services from Vodacom for our small business - and wow what a mission - Seems like they have adopted the old Post and Telecommunications mentality, disguised as Telkom that has been passed over to Vodacom. in times where businesses need dire growth, it is clear that Vodacom is comfortable - a real fat cat where customer service is the least on their mind. |\n",

On the bureau's side the Vodacom account reflected as active and not closed, while all the amounts were settled. I received a call from a Vodacom agent who thereafter forwarded the message to Vodacom accounts department. He assured me that I would receive a letter confirming the closure of this account once the accounts department had done so. I was to count 5-7 working days. Up until now I have not received any communication from the Vodacom accounts department of having this matter resolved. There is no direct line to reach Vodacom, except robots to try deal with my query. Vodacom's failure to close the Vodacom account when it was settled is placing me in a negative credit record with the bureau. Vodacom is also not following up with me as the person at the receiving end. If this is not solved I will have report it to the Ombudsman as my credit rating is being tarnished and I cannot buy a property in the near future.  |\n",

I got told to phone customer care to sort it out, I phone and get told to go back to the store so that they can do a decline review on the system. I go back to the store for the fourth time, being made aware that on the system the account is stating that is has been settled. They can't decline review, I must now phone the accounts department to get a settlement letter.

I phone the afternoon of the 2nd and was told it will be sent the 3rd. I receive nothing for a whole week and when trying to phone the accounts department again, the robot talking says that the number I'm phoning about has already phoned that day and that a consultant will phone back. I go back to another Vodacom store and they get through to the accounts department, I am assured that the letter will be sent through in less than 24hours because they had an incorrect email address, this was after giving the email address to 2 different consultants. The next day there is still no email from Vodacom with a settlement letter. I phone the accounts department again and am cut off 3 times by consultants without resolving the issue. It has now been 14 days waiting for Vodacom to fix a mistake they made in the first place. Another thing that I have made Vodacom aware of multiple times is that I receive the invoices and statements of another customer and it still has not been resolved after 3 or more years.  |\n",

So now he is still stuck with vas that he never gave permission for and bot a way to deactivate them. This is old people neglect and he has been a vodacom client for 20 years.

       "| 2021-02-21 23:05:58 | Vodacom | Pathetic service at Vodacom | <br />Contract held in my late husband's name, who passed away in Aug '20. I knew the cell contract was also coming to an end as Vodacom has my cell no on their records as contact and I was receiving messages. Since Sept '20 I have been trying to contact Vodacom to rearrange the monthly payments, because obviously the debit account that the Vodacom instalment is being deducted from, was to be frozen – all I wanted to do was pay cash or have the debit account changed to myself, as the phone was being used by my son – but Vodacom refused to discuss the matter with me – I eventually was able to speak to someone in their legal team who informed me they will only deal with Executor. My Executor did send through the required documents to instruct confirmation to change ownership to my son (on my instructions as he is actually the user of the phone) – this request was drawn out unnecessarily...  By the way, no message was sent advising of any arrear - even up till today!  Then all Vodacom replied with, was that my son must call on the branch with required paperwork, to change ownership – which he did the moment he was permitted an afternoon off.  But at the branch - there was confusion as to what they needed to do - then a few \"issues\" were advised to my son – firstly saying only the arrears had to be paid first, then he had to wait 4 days for it show on their Vodacom account, and only thereafter, was he to go back to change ownership – working in the service industry myself, that is an extraordinary process ie that in this day and age it cannot be dealt with at one time.  Secondly my son was informed that the cellphone number he had, no longer existed – it had been deleted 7 days after the instalment was returned… but oh – the Legal team failed to inform me of that process AND  failed to advised any of us that the cellphone number had been deleted from their system (having ignoring the fact that I tried to make payment and since December, my son tried to contact Vodacom to request he make payments direct (so as not to let account go into arrears ) – but he too was informed he could not so – simple as that). Although my son tried to explain he is the user of the phone and it is being used for personal and business, no-one wanted to assist him just for one month by letting him pay that one instalment - so he was without a cellphone for a few weeks - whilst waiting for Vodacom taking their sweet time to send information via the Executor.  So – on the day he went to the branch, and having found out he no longer had the cell number (that he has had last since school days),  he felt constricted and desperate enough that he took out a cellphone contract in his own name – which was unnecessary as he did not need an upgrade or the added debt – but being in a desperate situation that's what he did -  so well done to Vodacom for putting him in that situation!  At that point he advised the branch the existing contract in question was not his problem anymore and had to remain the estate problem.  And quite rightly after all the issues arising.  But - I want to get this debt paid now - I will be responsible at end of the day to pay the outstanding balance, but myself and the Executor are being ignored.   I have requested Vodacom Legal to provide me with one amount ie the arrear and the balance of contract, in order for me to pay it up – also requesting the bank account details as electronic transfer will be made - then the account must be cancelled.  How much simpler  can this request be.  I emailed Vodacom legal on 5/2/21 and to date no response – my Executor emailed them with same request ie to provide me with the one amount so it can be paid and closed – but no response. Having this unnecessary arrears and debt hanging over me is extremely stressful but more frustrating is having no contact person to complain to at Vodacom.  Why is there no details of where complaints can be lodged on the website!!!  I do not believe a whatsapp bot will not be able to deal with this query either - human intervention is required. The company should be jumping at the fact that this account I am wanting to close - but it is instead gaining momentum in arrears unnecessarily.  The lack of service, assistance, empathy - everything - from Vodacom has been absolutely pathetic.  Someone very senior needs to step in and sort this out. How difficult must they make life be, for a customer!  That company needs more than a shakeup from the very top head to the bottom employee because there is absolutely nothing positive happening there. Thank goodness for other cell companies – and when reading the complaints on the Vodacom complaints side it is just unbelievable that no matter what the issue is about, that people must complain to get attention to finalise things - Vodacom seriously needs to up their game that is non existent...<br /><br /> |\n",

I have called 3 to 4 times daily, send support emails and still no word frim them. The call centre staff are only trained to tell you a few things like robots: move around with your device to optimize, change APN and reset your device and send an escalation email to technical department. Technical department never responds so every time you call they take you through the same steps. It is clear that they have not connected me to the nearest satellites to my area but not even the supervisors can pick up the phone and call the technical department. The technical department appears not to even check if their infrastructure is working correctly or they totally rely on AI to decide even if it doesn't work for customers. The advent of customer care centres divorces companies from their responsibilities and frustrate and destroys the productivity of customers without compensation or improvement from these companies. They treat customers as technologically illerate while they fail even to collate a basic instruction pamphlet or leave room for complex problem-solving in their companies. The fact that customer care is not allowed to contact technical department by phone is beyond my understanding and the fact that supervisors promised to call back and never do shows very poor leadership and how companies are abusing customers by lack of access and direct communication and pure lack of professionalism.  |\n",

They both started laughing regarding my request and I could not make sense of what was being talked about as they spoke in another language. <br />I was then advised that I will be contacted 72 hours after I spoke to Customer care the day before who did not log a ticket for me after they said they would and now I had to wait longer. <br />I was then reminded that I'm not contracted which made me feel like Vodacom only cares about their contracted clients and not their prepaid as well. I have been with Vodacom for years. <br /><br />I was called the following day and was advised that the fault is with Vodacom in both my home town and the new place I moved to and that the area I moved to does not have enough towers in the area. The towers are congested from their side and that it can take between 2 months to 2 years before more towers are allocated. <br /><br />I then asked why am I paying for a service that I cannot use then and was told that it will be cancelled with no fees charged IF Vodacom cannot provide me with the 4G service, which they cannot. As I cannot make calls to family or clients, I cannot load mails and when it does load it takes incredibly long before anything happens, nor can I open a simple google document. <br />I have to work from home after work and on weekends where I have to use a VPN what tracks that I am online and working. It disconnects every 20min and it takes at least 10min to a connection of 1 bar going again. <br />I have also been told that my account cannot be created because the unused that gets relocated to the next month? What am I going to do with relocated data that cannot be used as it should be?<br /><br />I have received a mail stating that my queries have been resolved, however, I am still on 1 bar of the signal as well as my wifi disconnecting every 15min to 20min.<br /><br />Nobody is taking this seriously or giving me alternative options for a service I pay for just because its a prepaid phone number and I pay a small amount for the wifi. The self-help options are horrifying and the TOBI bot does not work when requestion for a \"human\" to get in contact with you. <br /><br />Absolutely horrible service from the so-called \"best service provider in SA\" <br /><br />I have 3 reference numbers all saying resolved however I am still struggling. <br />   |\n",

If I didn't know better, I died and am now spending and eternity in purgatory, because whether its 082 135, their so called \"online chat\" or even their more so called \"intelligent chat bot\", all roads lead to a dead end and you never get to speak to anyone about anything. Wait too long in the chat and it just drops you, the IVR never happens to have an option to speak to a human and the intelligent chat bot was clearly designed by someone with a room temperature IQ. Oh and don't try email the customer services mailbox either; For me, as a non-Vodacom customer, it asks you to tell it various pieces of information about a fraudulent account that was set up in your name, which you obviously won't have access to, and then when you don't provide that information, it simply ignores your email. Truly another award winning piece of development done there by Vodacom, well done.<br /><br />This company does not care about anyone in the slightest. If you are at any point considering using them to provide you a \"service\", literally look anywhere else because it will probably be better. The message is clear: Give us your money, but we have no interest in talking to you about anything. |\n",

Days later again I phone cell c to reduce my spend limit as it has depleted R10.56 at the time and the agent promised to carry the instruction. Today I check my app and cell c did not  reduce the spend limit and they claim I have already used R76.76 and they can’t assist me. In the past I have asked cell c to reduce my spend limit and there has never been a mistake for them not to reduce a spend limit. Now that I am canceling my contract with useless ‘cell sea’ and they want to milk everything and anything because they have financial troubles. Anyone who plan to take contract with ‘cell Sea’ keep in mind that you will be subjected to their rude consultants who behave like robots and their non existent team leaders and management. This cell sea is more corrupt than the South African government. Cell c staff members have milked the company and now we must pay the price today. Their employees have inflated tender prices and now we have to suffer. Here is proof on why cell sea today is limping and how come auditors never saw this https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timeslive.co.za/amp/news/south-africa/2021-01-22-former-cell-c-executive-arrested-in-connection-with-r64m-fraud/. If you are planning to sign up with cell sea keep in mind their prices increase without notification and cell c change their products without consulting or offering you options to choose from. Keep in mind cell sea staff member will lock your simcard if they can’t resolve your query and you are breathing at their neck. It makes sense why cell sea has migrated its customers to the two big networks. They don’t have resources and skill to handle such and you as a customer you should be asking yourself why do you buy vodacom or MTN when you can go directly to them and have better service |\n",

I received a message from Vodacom at 14:08 saying if i recharged through the app Just For You bundles I would receive 48.0 vodabucks, I then bought a 30MB for 30min on the app under Just For You but didn't receive the 48.0 vodabucks as promised by the text i received. I then used Vodacom Bot and asked to speak to a human, spoke to Mohau  and he couldnt resolve my query as to why i didn't receive the vodabucks as promised, I then asked to speak to a manager after being on a call for 34min without getting a resolution, he put me on hold and afterwards told me there is no manager available as their team leader is off and the other one has gone has gone home, when initially he said their managers are working from home, he then put on a colleague when i told him i dont want to speak to a colleague but a manager and a gentleman by the name on Manelaku or something of that sort who was rude,talked over me and told me to call tomorrow since theres no manager and hung up on me.I couldnt believe how people played with their jobs when so many of us being unemployed.

Like any other network there are inconsistencies, however they deal with an issue instantly. I feel they pride themselves on their excellent communication with their customers. It's like everyone that works at Vodacom is nice, intelligent and thinks for both the business and the client and not those other people that can only tell you about the \"System\" but fail to use their human knowledge to try to understand a customer's complaint. <br /><br />Thanks Vodacom for always coming through. <br /><br />My issue with regards to unknown interest charges of only R100 were reversed withon days. I received my statement for the month and the transaction was reversed without any delays or run around.  <br /><br />Some networks you will see charges of over thousands and they still fail to explain where those come from or fail to understand your query as a customer. They just tell you about what the system calculates. So frustrating and very robotic. <br /><br />I mention the issue with other networks ( Cell C) not to hype Vodacom but to emphasize on how Vodacom prioritizes that make sure they have long lasting customers. <br /><br />I'm for sure even my kids will use Vodacom in future just because of how important they treat you when you need to handle something. <br /><br />May Vodacom be the longest lasting network the world had ever seen. All your employees are Kind and LOGICAL. Even when the client is wrong they are respectful in their speech and never just hang up on a client without understanding them. <br /><br />I hope other networks learn from your etiquette. <br /><br />Best regards to whomever reads this. <br /><br />Your awesome.<br /><br />In life, make sure you always work with the best. We live in a fast paced age. And we need accurate and fast paced services. If that's what you offer, it should be what you provide. <br /><br />Thanks for sticking to your Word Vodacom. I'm not mad at you anymore that my phone wasn't replaced when it got stolen ( I didn't have insurance) I was so mad. I'm still paying for that phone now at least I still get to enjoy the benefits.<br /><br />Cell C on the other hand I have the phone but I'm not receiving the benefits. That time I'm paying on a monthly basis. Imagine. <br /><br />Never stop being a great service provider and never stop changing the way you deal with your customers. <br /><br />Only evolve. <br /><br />Take care lol this is like a novel but oh well. I'm feeling Very appreciative of Vodacom and great businesses today.  |\n",

The money has come off my credit card, but the airtime has not been credited to my phone. Tried the online chat and was thrown out ('your chat has been ended'), then tried calling the helpline and again did not get anywhere - told there were high caller volumes and I should chat tot TOBI the chatbot, or call back later and then was thrown out of the call. No option to just stay in a waiting line.... <br />Very bad service Vodacom!  |\n",
       "| 2021-01-08 08:26:08 | Vodacom | Vodacom Billing For Non Service | After spending my morning being passed from one department to the next, automated voice prompts, and calls being transferred by people that dont want to assist, I am extremely frustrated with Vodacom.<br /><br />I had a data contract which ended around June last year if I am not mistaken, but this morning I get a R2800 bill. This data has never been used and I am sure you can track that.<br /><br />The 3rd party that you utilize tried to renew the contract last year which is when I informed them I did not want to and they can cancel at the end of the term (being around June last year). They were not happy as I had a Rain solution in place so their solution wasnt required.<br /><br />Now Vodacom tells me it was never cancelled and that the 3rd party cant cancel my contract when they are the ones that signed me up, and I was not informed that I would still be billed for a service I was no longer using.<br /><br />I would like to speak to a person (not a robot) to have this sorted out.<br /><br />Thanks |\n",

I need to get get through to Vodacom or they need to call me on **********  |\n",
       "| 2021-01-05 18:30:46 | Vodacom | Vodacom's dishonesty | Vadacom -A dishonest company. I have been trying to cancel my contract since july 2020. Finally I got a consultant who assisted and my contract was canceled in Oct.  All of sudden end of Nov a debit goes through for the very contract he was offering which I had vehemently declined. I used their chatbot service only to find out they placed me in legal. Imagine the cheek! All these  people make you  fight for your last cent and create such drama instead of executing simple requests. Best part no one calls you on the provided number you gave which happens to be another service provider but you have a sales agent calling on that number to sell you a vodacom contract. <br />I am really mad at Vodacom. Vodacom were is your integrity as a consumer provider ? Do you think you are above the consumer act?<br />I want an agent , with powers- not someone who has to refer 5times, to call me and remove the legal status which is due to your incompetence and not technical difficulties. <br />I am giving you a chance... I challenge: Redeem yourself! |\n",
       "| 2021-01-05 16:33:36 | Telkom | billed on the cancelled contract  | Good day<br />I have been calling Telkom from October regarding the billing on the cancelled contract , they billed me NOVEMBER r and December , i called in for refund on the 21OF DEC  and I spoke to Delisile which she promised that she will communicate with me regarding the refund and she even send the confirmation of the cancellation, she didn't call to provide feed back  she said it sent to the manager but no response they keep billing  me, i spoke to Pulane  after speaking to Delisile she escalated but still billed again and penalized for reversing the debit since they didn't refund me.<br />i called in today which is the 01/05/2020 spoke to Fikile  requesting the paid up letter and cancellation letters she said i will get feedback before 12 but still its now 4:15 no call. i call again i spoke to a programmed consultant Princess  WHO WILL TELL ME ABOUT THE PROCESS OF TELKOM THOUGH SHE SEE THAT THIS IS NOT MY FIRST CALL and its not assistance . she said its escalated to Granny and this granny is not contacting nor  doing anything about the billing. my risk profile is ruined , my credit risk is ruined all because of the contract that i never missed any premiums until the agreed time.<br /><br />please rectify and please train Princess that its not a problem to sometimes forget the book cause she sound like a robot , sometimes you must try to think on ways to assist if the process that YOU follow don't assist your customers.<br /><br />Herrison Malonga PLEASE CHECK IF YOU TEAMLEADERS DO CONTACT CLIENT CAUSE SINCE OCTOBER HAVING THE SAME QUERY WHICH ALL CONSULTANT THAT I SPOKE TO CONFIRM THAT I SUPPOSE NOT TO BE DEBITED AND WILL GET REFUND BUT no HELP.<br /><br />I wanted to upgrade and a consultant from sales team promise to call and neve called. so it seems like its Telkom values to avoid client and you never prioritize your client. I no longer want the upgrade.<br /><br />i ported my number from Vodacom to Telkom and this kind  of service makes me think that I took a wrong decision <br /><br />I will never advise a person to take a contract with Telkom  |\n",
       "| 2021-01-04 11:56:13 | Vodacom | The worst customer care and call center | I missed a debit order in December and made arrangement for another debit to go off on the 26th of December. Vodacom then just blocked my numbers on the 26th without even trying to debit my account or contacting me. I then called and arranged ANOTHER debit order which did actually go off on the 28th of December. <br /><br />It is now the 4th of January and my lines are still blocked. Vodacom's call center does not answer phones, Kept on hold for 1 hour 15 mins until I gave up. I have left 2 messages to call me back. Their chatbot does not respond, their online chat is offline. What is going on over there?<br /><br />I cannot make any other calls other than 135 (which they do not answer)<br /><br />It is my last resort to leave a review on hellopeter as I don't know what else to do. |"
