    "Tired of speaking to TOBI, we need humans\tI bought WhatsApp bundles for R35 on the 13th July 2023, which have not been allocated till today the 20th, but i was rewarded with 3.5 Vodabucks. On the 14th I called customer service but was referred to TOBI the BOT, of which it was hard for TOBI to understand because he is an Automated Machine, I then asked to speak to a human, with no success. Sent an email to customer care, got a reference but no call back. I went to Sandton branch, but they could not help me because I bought the data online via capitec app. Can we please speak to humans, its really tiring not being able to express yourself. Kindly serve your customers well, this is really frustrating.\n",

    "Appalling service\tMTN, in my experience, has to rate as probably the very worst service provider I have ever had the misfortune to deal with, and right up there with Telkom and ADT. Without going into specifics, because it would take too long, MTN, for me, incorporates huge difficulty in speaking to a human to start with, then it is almost impossible to speak to the right human amongst calls being misdirected, those on the receiving end having conflicting information or supplying no information, and then, after applying tenacity of an almost impossible degree, amongst dropped calls, to be told that someone would definitely come back to me as the problem has been escalated, and then deathly silence. Let's go 135 again and set aside a day, I say. After three hours I valiantly admit defeat. You win, MTN. I need to now extricate myself from a debit order and change service providers which should take possibly another two or three days of effort. However, MTN, you will receive the very worst feedback from me to everyone I know, unfortunately. I have no doubt that this email will either be ignored or I will get an AI bot asking me for my name and number and to explain my problem.\n",

The money has come off my credit card, but the airtime has not been credited to my phone. Tried the online chat and was thrown out ('your chat has been ended'), then tried calling the helpline and again did not get anywhere - told there were high caller volumes and I should chat tot TOBI the chatbot, or call back later and then was thrown out of the call. No option to just stay in a waiting line.... <br />Very bad service Vodacom!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The customer complained about being thrown out of the chat with TOBI the chatbot                                                                           |\n",

Vodacom, your bot is daft, as it does nothing but lead me into a rabbit whole of endless nonsensical illusions of promises to be called by an agent. FYI, bills are paid, service is terrible, no communication on any of my devices (I have 3 with you after you sold me 2 ****les in the past along with useless laptops - that was apparently “a great deal” according to your sales people. Anyway, please call me... as I cannot call you - it has been 30 days, and if I can’t do business via my phone, I can’t get money to pay you, and you keep on locking my phone, and so the evil continues. Seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The chatbot does not provide helpful assistance and leads the customer into a frustrating experience.                                                      |\n",

Buried in an endless loop of incompetence and dropped calls. Good luck if you try call again. Start all over.

Please note: <br />This is a system-generated email that requires your response in order to be processed. After that, a Customer Care agent will contact you within 24 hours.<br /><br />Protecting your Vodacom account from fraud is important to us, so before we can help you with your query, we need to verify that you are the owner of this account.<br /><br />Please reply to this email with these three bits of personal information:<br /><br />ID number or Company Registration Number for corporate accounts<br />Bank name and account type<br />Your Vodacom account number<br />Have you collectively taken leave of your senses !! you want to make sure I am who I say I am, from an email address on your system, and you want me to send my personal details to an automated mail address that could well be fraudulent ?? and thats for the privilege of having my query addressed. Go F yourselves! <br />I have been at the sharp end of some of our pretty dodgy SOE departments, but you guys are seriously leading that competition - by a long shot !!<br /><br />Now - what is your complaint you may ask. Its not going to get resolved in this public platform, so I'm not going to air it here, save to say that complaint number 1 is the impossible task of finding some one that gives enough of an F to take responsibility, and solve the problem !! I cannot waste more hours ( I have called numerous times, mailed, chatted to the robot, been into a store) and I still sit feeling like my service provider ( there's a laugh) really doesn't give a continental stuff !! - and so I resort to Hello Peter.<br /><br />Surprise me Vodacom, if its within you. Someone with backbone, the will to make a difference and the authority to make a customer of 23 years - believe again. <br /><br />                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The customer is complaining about the lack of resolution to their issues and the unhelpful responses received.                                             |\n",

If I didn't know better, I died and am now spending and eternity in purgatory, because whether its 082 135, their so called \"online chat\" or even their more so called \"intelligent chat bot\", all roads lead to a dead end and you never get to speak to anyone about anything. Wait too long in the chat and it just drops you, the IVR never happens to have an option to speak to a human and the intelligent chat bot was clearly designed by someone with a room temperature IQ. Oh and don't try email the customer services mailbox either; For me, as a non-Vodacom customer, it asks you to tell it various pieces of information about a fraudulent account that was set up in your name, which you obviously won't have access to, and then when you don't provide that information, it simply ignores your email. Truly another award winning piece of development done there by Vodacom, well done.<br /><br />This company does not care about anyone in the slightest. If you are at any point considering using them to provide you a \"service\", literally look anywhere else because it will probably be better.

      "|  50 | Vodacom Customer Care                                                                                                                                                                    | After listening to the automated menu on your customer care line far too many times and trying to wait it out for the consultant on nearly every menu option mostly unrelated to the issue I wanted to solve, I FINALLY managed to get through to a consultant who was very helpful. I can't even remember during which part of the menu I was finally offered the option to hold for a consultant because your customer care line keeps trying to divert to your \"self-help\" bot \"Tobi\".<br /><br />Suggestions from a customer if you do not want to lose customers in future:<br /><br />1. If you want people to use the bot, that's all good and well, but make sure it at least works before you place it in your call menu. <br /><br />2. After going through nearly your entire call menu to get to a consultant, I can at least let you know, your \"Tobi\" bot only \"works\" on SMS, not WhatsApp. Even if you select the WhatsApp option. I can also tell you, typing \"menu\" as instructed after the bot texts, does not work. Typing ANY word relating to possible Vodacom issues such as \"account\", \"billing\", \"cancellations\" (I can go on), does not work. An annoying message just pops up saying the bot cannot help me with this, please dial 082 135. The sad reality is that customer care number sent me to the bot more times than I can count. <br /><br />3. Another area that needs fixing is getting into my account online. Once I have a set fee for a year or more, I don't go into my account online. Therefore I can never seem to remember the password I use the random time a couple years ago that I wanted to check when my contract is due for an upgrade. If I click \"forgot password\", it sends me an OTP. Which is all good and well, that works. However, when they send a new password for you to use, even after 1 min, 1 hour, 1 day. It will never work. So I cannot get into MY Vodacom account, FORCING me to phone customer care, which is pretty much FORCING me to use the broken bot.<br /><br />4. After finally reaching a very helpful consultant which is all I was looking for in the first place and they asked me to rate their service, you give an option to give them a 10 for very satisfactory. However, every time I typed 10, it said I gave the consultant a 1, and asked if I meant to give them a 1. Why ask to rate a 10 if a person can't give a 10 rating? Why not just make 9 the highest rating?<br /><br />I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I had to spend at least 2 hours of my time trying to get into my account online and phoning customer care to speak to a consultant to finally fix such a small issue. Fortunately for you, I'm quite patient, but I'm definitely not happy with having to try so many different avenues which is what took up my time. I can tell you now, there are many customers out there that would never have put up with this. The punchline, I just wanted to find out why my account was so high last month because for some reason I didn't receive an invoice for last month when I moved from a normal cell phone contract to only a data contract.  <br /><br />On a positive note, while I was trying to access a consultant, I eventually had an idea to contact you on FB messenger. I received a reply within 5 minutes. Unfortunately, it came through just after a consultant answered the phone and helped me. I wish I had thought of taking that route first as I could have had 2 hours of my life to do something more useful and I wouldn't have written this poor review.<br /><br />By the way, I would have given you a rating of 1 but seeing as your actual consultants are polite and willing to help I raised it to 2. | The customer complained about the chatbot diverting their call and not being helpful.                                                                      |\n",

I bought a product were is it? What is this extremely high call volumes your talking about? (If it is true stop selling, reduce, implement that you can assist the customer’s you already have). Please explain this Vodacom, how is it possible to rate service if it only rings, well zero if you ask me, felt like i am apart of ghost hunters and on the same note back ground music, tone it down a little soft and gentle would i prefer on the ear Vodacom especially holding line endlessly for the hope of a answer.

Vodacom uses any balance to automatically purchase airtime. Today I recharged with R110. R61 went to airtime advance. R23.96 to a call. I had a balance of 25.04. I wanted to buy a WhatsApp ticket for R3 as I was leaving the house where I have fiber. As soon as i dialed *111# and buy it automatically took R25 and it allocated me a data bundle for 100meg that I never requested. Ii have suspected that my airtime has gone missing but this time i saw it happen in front of my eyes. the system is programmed to make sure your balance is zero.. when you buy a product it keeps on promoting you tying to find how to use all your balance. I have had enough. Then I tried to get help but the STUPID Tobi Bot kept making a fool of me. that bot things is such a disrespect to clients! As usuall it did not help. I tried to log a query. that does not work.  I tried 135 that was another machine. there is no chat feature. basically you cannot get through to a help agent for Vodacom. They don't allow you to complain or get help! That was the last time. I am mobilising on social media and the news- its time for clients to boycott Vodacom. ALL the people I know on Vodacom say their airtime disappears and they cant get help. TIME TO BOYCOTT VODACOM. WATCH THIS SPACE. WE HAVE BEEN DISRESPECTED ENOUGH. ITS TIME FOR VODACOM TO BE SHOWN THE DOOR. If you think I am pulling wool over your eyes Vodacom, hide and watch. Its time this issue is solved publicly and  nationally. Time to embarrass them into changing their ways                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The customer is complaining about the chatbot not being helpful                                                                                            |\n",

Then I tried the chat bot TOBi but it wouldn't allow you to type. Then I got through to a consultant but I already placed an upgrade order for the Samsung Galaxy S21 Grey only to get an SMS to say there is no stock of the device, the consultant said they only have the violet colour. I was going to give my dad my S10e for his birthday but now I have to wait after his birthday because the new stock is allegedly available only on his birthday, MTN has better deals and they have stock of the grey S21.

I am trying to assist an old gentleman with his vodamail password but even after reseeting it it does not work and vodacom support has been no help at all, as I can not ecen speak to someone, tried to phone upgeades and funny enough they answer and if I ask them to put me through to support they say I must just press option 2, as I told them option 2 is for sim swap, they can not help me. I will also not be upgrading my phone at Vodacom this August and also from August not buy any data from vodacom anymore, if you can't help someone with a simple issue like a email password that is not working why should I support you?

I try calling the call centre, and after being redirected through various options, then a stupid chatbot that adds no value other than sending you in circles, I eventually get to the option to be routed to a call centre agent, then as I get dial tone, it cuts me off after 10 minutes of waiting to get through.<br /><br />I spent 2000 Vodabucks for a new handset and no word of it in 2 months.<br /><br />Do NOT use your Vodabucks - it's a scam!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The customer is complaining about the chatbot being unhelpful and causing frustration.                                                                     |\n",

      "| 112 | Customer Personal Info Not Safe at Vodacom!!!                                                                                                                                            | I have been a loyal customer of Vodacom for years. I appreciate their efforts in improving customer service.<br /><br />I ,however, have a big concern with how readily available a customer's info is. Today I had to access my PUK number and I used Vodacom's chatbot Tobi via my laptop.<br /><br />Tobi did not even verify who I was, I was just prompted to input the cell number I needed the PUK for and wallllaaaa! Tobi gave me the PUK!<br /><br />I was thrilled for a second then it hit me that actually anyone who has my number can get my PUK this easily!.

The item was then out of stock and I have trying to get my refund since then.<br /><br />Numerous calls later having spoken to amongst many others, Thabang and her supervisor Anastacia Ndlovu at Vodacom Rewards but to no avail.<br /><br />Then there are times that you call Vodacom Customer Support and you hold for ages, then you get diverted without you requesting it, to the Bot who has no clue what you are talking about. The Bot then says that you will called back by an agent which never happens.<br /><br />Trying to speak to Vodacom is the most frustrating thing. And they are supposed to be in communications??<br /><br />Not sure if they just want to steal my money.<br /><br />All because of this, I am going to cancel contracts with Vodacom. Imagine if I have a cellular related problem?? Will it also take 3 weeks without assistance.<br /><br />I have no option but to maybe escalate to ICASA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The customer is frustrated with the chatbot's lack of understanding and inability to provide assistance.                                                   |\n",

It is impossible to speak to a human being - they put you through to some bot named Tobi, make you hold for 20 minutes, and then cut you off.

I could use my phone only as that . Of course I tried to contact Vodacom by sending them messages-  and by phoning in . Their robot TOBi is incredibly infuriating ,asking all the most stupid questions and only making one more frustrated and furious. The internet is back now for me in a very sketchy fashion- I wanted Some sort of BOOSTER from Vodacom in my home but who do you ask at a business which you cannot contact in any meaningful way? I spend nearlyR1000 a month on my contract but nobody there cares a hoot!IWhat a lack of customer empathy , interaction and care!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The chatbot TOBi is described as infuriating and not helpful                                                                                               |\n",

I have in the past reached out to Vodacom to remove the song. I went into a Vodashop for assistance, I dialed the numbers to opt out of the subscription, I've cancelled the subscription on the My Vodacom app. Nowhere did I find joy. What's most annoying is that if I don't go into a Vodashop to speak to a consultant,  all I have is a useless bot that has standardised responses that don't help anyone. Only time you speak to an actual person is when they're trying to sell you more things you don't need. Or you owe them. <br /><br />Please, advise on how to remove this song from my line. My employment is being affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The customer complained about the chatbot's inability to assist with removing an unwanted caller tune.                                                     |\n",
      "| 168 | Vodacom is useless and clearly don't want their money                                                                                                                                    | I am trying to open a new contract with Vodacom.I was informed there is an amount outstanding in my name of a contract I had 4 years ago.That contract was closed years ago with the settlement amount I received from Vodacom at that stage.Never have they sent me communication that anything was outstanding in 4 years.<br />None the less I agreed to pay whatever is outstanding and gave permision for a debit order to go off.<br />It was suppose to be done yesterday. So far the debit order has not been done by Vodacom.Trying to get hold of a human being in the accounts department is impossible.Trying to speak to an operator is impossible.I have tried every number on their site.The Bots and useless voice message promting you to enter cell numbers,ID numbers,to say something after the beep etc is the WORST waste of time ever and calls get cut.<br />Could Vodacom please just have an actual operator answer your call when you phone.These recorded options and that stupid useless Tobi Bot is beyond frustrating and of no use.I want to pay my account,but Vodavon doesn't seem to want my money as I can't get hold of someone in accounts no matter what.Please please please please can someone from Vodacom accounts phone me.I can't believe thst you have to go through all that recording **** to get help.Please get rid of it and have an actual operator assist you.I am waiting fir your call.Otherwise Vodacom must never ask me to settle an amount because they clearly don't want the money or new bussiness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The customer is complaining about the difficulty of reaching a human operator and the frustration with the chatbot and recorded options.                   |\n",

Can a consultant please contact me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The customer is complaining about the chatbot Tobi being useless and not understanding their issue                                                         |\n",

Mweb and Cool Ideas gave me this after 1 email. <br />Unbelievable...the poor agent said that she could only give me what the Bot Tobi could provide!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The customer is complaining about the chatbot Tobi's inability to provide a document summarizing their billing for the current tax year                    |\n",

I was duly notified that there was no stock and again duly notified and kept in the loop once the stock arrived as well as being adviced when the parcel was handed over to RAM couriers. The delivery was scheduled for Wednesday at my home address but I had notified both Vodacom and RAM that I had to be at the office and requested change of address. On Thursday I had made a follow up with RAM's Xavier who ensured me that my parcel would be out on delivery the next day, Friday 10/12/2021. I have not received the delivery as promised. When I followed up around lunch time I was told by RAM that my parcel is still with them, all the drivers were out for the day already. I was not given a proper reason t=why my parcel was left behind. The excuse I was given was that the drivers were not sure of my delivery address as the address they (RAM) had on the system was incorrect. I have proof I had received via RAM's ChatBot that actually the alternative (work) address I had given was indeed CORRECT and that was just a lousy excuse as to why my parcel was not loaded in the morning. I am not impressed with this and almost on the brink of cancelling the whole thing!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The complaint is related to the delivery process of an online upgrade.                                                                                     |\n",

When i explained to the consutant what my dilemma was....he kept on repeating that i must never ever call that number again...very unprofessional to tell this to a customare....vodacom i just lost all faith in you guys...goodbye                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The customer had a bad experience with the customer care robot Tobi.                                                                                       |\n",
      "| 213 | Vodacon diaries - consumer company that hates consumers                                                                                                                                  | I believe consumer focused companies should never be measured by their ability to sell you new products but rather by how they stand by and support you when their services let you down. <br /><br />Vodacom is one of those consumer companies that is only to happy to take your money for the average service they deliver, but completely abandons you when you most need them when their own service, systems and people fail you. <br /><br />Vodacom is not a brand to be trusted or relied on, they will consistently fail you and charge you handsomely for the priviledge.<br /><br />While I was traveling out the country some random individual did a sim swap and a substantial upgrade on mobile phone account all via a call center. This resulted in a number of other attempts to access other relationships I hold by the parties who conducted the fraudulent upgrades. Sim swaps and fraudulent upgrades occur, that I understand does happen. However when you paint your company as a technology company that is nothing without humanity, you then cannot remove humanity from your organisation and leave your customers to fend entirely for themselves.<br /><br />There is a not a human employee of Vodacom that you can talk to find out why your account is blocked, how a fraudulent transaction was carried out and when your services will be reconnected as everything channels through Tobi the chatbot who is able to sell you more airtime or upgrade a phone but fraud ... no can do.<br /><br />All staff in the stores are franchise staff, who face the same challenges as the consumer, so again no easy fix and they are largely helpless unless you need airtime or an upgrade. <br /><br />Speaking of upgrades, short of providing a DNA swap I get asked for all kinds of supporting documents when upgrading mobile phones in pursuit of RICA, FICA and other regulatory requirements. So my only conclusion is that there is some form of syndicate operating within Vodacom to enable this activity without the same level of due diligence taking place. <br /><br />My question to Vodacom is why focus so much getting customers into you ecosystem if you have no plans to support them once they are in it. I have been a customer for 20 years (not loyal, just easier not to change to another provider that is as bad as yourselves) and have grown to dislike the company intensely - not because I feel I am overcharged (although I am) or because I constantly drop calls (which I do) but because when I need assistance to resolve issues there is no one to assist adequately or timeously. <br /><br />Be better                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The customer is complaining about the lack of human support and assistance from Vodacom when facing issues with fraudulent activity on their account.      |\n",

I want that person to dail 135 and have a problem that isn't part of the once that are given to you neither when you chat to robot.

Why do we then have an app???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The customer complained about the inefficiency of the Vodacom chatbot and phone app.                                                                       |\n",

I have been calling daily trying to speak to a consultant and i am not winning. Instead i am forced to speak to a robot .bought 120mb data at 09:05 today. 2minutes later the data is finished..as much as things arecexpensive i cannot keep buying data and daily it does that does not last.. it not the first this is happening..i am wondering why do we have to struggle and be robbed for a service we paying. I am 100% that i dont have any apps that are using background data cause i made sure i switch it off. Secondly i won a 50 off dischem voucher from:Vodacom: Congrats! You've won a R50 off any purchase at Dis-Chem from Dis-Chem. Use code **********40 in-store before 20/12/2021. T&Cs apply.guess what i could not even redeem it at dischem. Was told the voucher is invalid .here is another voucher i couldn't redeem:Vodacom: Congrats! You've won a Free 350ml Smoothie when you buy any wrap from Kauai from Kauai. Use code **********94 in-store before 18/01/2022. T&Cs appl. This shows what scammers you are. I am tired of this nonsense..you guys dont even announce your winners for all these big prizers for your draws..i think its time i report this to  consumer  obudsman and competition comissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The customer is frustrated with the chatbot and being forced to speak to a robot instead of a consultant.                                                  |\n",

I was not even given a chance to speak to an actual consultant so that my actual problem could be resolved.<br /><br />I have a virtual interview and if i cannot get in touch with the interviewers because of network issues, since that was the problem i was trying to resolve (which has been since Sunday evening 30/01/22) I will find a way to sue Vodacom for job loss because this is ridiculous really!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The customer is unhappy with the chatbot's inability to resolve their issue and not providing an option related to their problem.                          |\n",

Nobody called back to follow up as per the message after the completion of the order. The online chatbot bombed out halfway through the conversation. I eventually spoke to Mellisa Pillay who advised me that the phone that I'm looking to purchase is out of stock (on backorder for 6 weeks). Excuses ranging from  \"the website needs to be updated\" , to \"all our customers know our terms and conditions regarding phones that are out of stock\" were dished out. Yet for the past 2 weeks, these deals have been advertised on the website. Amazingly enough, there are deals clearly grayed out stating clearly that certain contracts are out of stock. <br />Not being able to transfer me to a senior person due to working remotely was another excuse to cut the call.<br />What complete rubbish and pathetic service Vodacom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The chatbot malfunctioned and did not provide assistance as expected.                                                                                      |\n",

I paid an exorbitant amount for this early cancellation. My phone contract was cancelled a few days later and I was moved to pre-paid immediately.<br /><br />Fast forward to the 1st March, and my bank account was debited the monthly contract fee, even though the contract was cancelled and ALL outstanding fees paid upfront via the early cancellation fee.<br /><br />I asked my wife to contact you as she's still in South Africa, but she was just told they can't help her and that I need to contact Vodacom via live chat or an email to customer care.

Can someone who speaking Afrikaans please phone me back?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The customer is complaining about not wanting to be helped by a chatbot                                                                                    |\n",

Nothing happened.<br />I tried to speak to a human today but Tobi tried to help me and he doesn't understand anything because it's a bot.<br />Then a consultant called me and she couldn't understand the difference between Mastercard and Masterpass and told me to speak to my bank because she can't see anything on the system. <br />Kindly refund me or give me my airtime.<br />Also kindly train your support people better.<br />Also, Tobi is dumb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The customer is complaining about the chatbot Tobi not being able to understand their issue                                                                |\n",

The number is **********.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The customer is complaining about the inability to discuss the issue with a robot                                                                          |\n",
      "| 273 | Vodacom Customer Care Line inefficient, inconvenient and no customer friendly.                                                                                                           | The Vodacom customer care service line is by far the most useless and user-unfriendly service. It's a great example of a failed application of artificial intelligence. One needs to be on the line for at least 85 minutes, trying to bypass the Toby robot which is a complete waste of time, then get bounced around at least 7 departments until you get to the Customer Care. <br /><br />They still have the 082 135 number on invoices, only to be told the number is no longer in use.<br /><br />All in all, it's a painful exercise to get a service one pays for. <br /><br />Highly inefficient and a great inconvenience.

They are by far the most irritating part about moving into the future. And ehere it starts for mebis vodacom. Tobi is a C@#t. I am sorry to say i ewill be leaving Vodacom just because of him. I dont want to speak to a machine. And i can not get through to a human. And Vodacom are stealing from me and they hope because i dont speak to a  human my problem goes away and i just leave it. Well sorry for them i will post a fantastic review like this for the rest of my life telling everyone how kak they are. <br />Hell man i am a programmer , i will right a multiplying bot that will post on the internet where ever it can how kak they are.  I will do this g i am not contacted and my data and airtime is not replaced within one hour. The board of directors are all monkeys and they should go back to the zoo. And we should get the baboons there to come run vodacom. They will definitely do a better job and that will save more than 1000 call centre staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The customer is unhappy with the chatbot Tobi and finds it irritating.                                                                                     |\n",

      "| 284 | If you're not always in SA and near a shop, run far and run fast                                                                                                                         | Trying to buy airtime.  Both the site and app claim to offer this option, but both just report \"a technical problem\".  The site and app claim to offer online chat.  On the site this just leads to a page with a submit button that doesn't work (the dev console reports that the site won't accept the call from its own button). On the app it just leads to the eternally pointless chatbot. I'll never understand why businesses don't wait until someone creates a chatbot that is actually useful before starting to use them.  Unfortunately the only other way Vodacom offers for contacting them is by phone.  That's all very well when in South Africa, but not every customer is in SA all the time.  So they've now blocked any customer who needs support outside of SA from getting any.  Unless they can afford the cost of an international call, of course.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a company that pretends to offer features and sees to it that contacting them ranges from difficult to impossible, look no further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The chatbot is not useful and does not provide any assistance                                                                                              |\n",

Toby (I hate bots) can’t handle complex issues especially when you need help in hurry. It comes across as the company’s way of scamming their clients if you can’t claim back your money for their mess ups. Which happen a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The customer is complaining about Vodacom's chatbot Toby                                                                                                   |\n",

Buy bundles but never receive all paid for.<br />2. Complete goals to get vodabucks but mostly don't get it.<br />3. Try complaining and you get shoved in the hands of a robot, Tobi.<br />4. Acc got hacked once and airtime used plus advance and they said it's me.<br />5. Worse of all is the rate in which data prices keep climbing, yet you never get the value advertised and never close enough to getting compensation for your money and what's owed. <br />.I'm done with Vodacom now and switching networks coz I can't be giving my money to the company who has more anyway.

I have now spent hours of my time trying to get some sort of indication when my issue will be resolved and just to get clarity on the way forward regarding my current account and wether it now has been canceled along with the debit order.<br /><br />I keep hearing the same story over and over again which is automated bot responses. We are really sorry and we have escalated the matter please allow us some time. How much time do you need? Time is a more valuable than anything in life and you are wasting mine.<br /><br />SR**********41, let me spel it out, EVERYTHING has already been installed, so please do not send a team unannounced to my home again over a weekend, them having no knowledge of the issue and merely informing me there is nothing they can do, a Technical team needs to come out to adress the low connection issue. I have spoken to industry experts saying it is such a small fix, yet i have now been waiting from the 7th of April for this Team to be in contact. Worst of all, knowing the lead time of this so long, I started my enquiry in February already to ensure we do not sit in this situation, yet its more than two months with zero connection and i have to carry the burden of extremely high mobile data cost. <br /><br />I urge you to please get this resolved within the next 24 hours.<br /><br />Johann                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The customer is complaining about the lack of customer centricity and the repeated automated bot responses                                                 |\n",

If you are thinking on using them...DON'T! I purchased an Apple Watch cellular last year and what an absolute nightmare it was getting it activated with Vodacom. This year, my watch was replaced and I activated the cellular service again through the Watch app on the iPhone. Everything appeared to be in working order. I was charged for the activation and have been paying a monthly fee for the OneNumber service. Unfortunately, the service has mysteriously stopped working. I have tried emailing Vodacom - no reply. Then I tried the Tobi chatbot - useless. Then I spoke to a consultant - equally as clueless. She kept telling me to activate the service that is already activated!  I am still being charged for a service that does not work. The iPhone Watch app shows the Vodacom plan as \"not in use\". The watch, when tapping the icon to activate mobile data, shows a black screen. Turning everything on and off DOES NOT WORK VODACOM. Nobody seems to know what the hell is happening. I delayed upgrading with Vodacom for years but eventually succumbed and boy do I regret it. I cannot seem to get any competent assistance with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The customer complained about the chatbot being useless and not providing any assistance                                                                   |\n",

On my online queries I have found their victual robot ''To be'' unable to resolve the issues I had. Theoretical scenarios were given as a resolution which, and the only thing achieved was a waste of my time, and infuriating.<br /><br />I got a contract with Vodacom for a Tablet for my son, the number that came with it is defect. By that I mean I can not call him, calls from a cellphone do not go through, regardless of the network.<br />Also, he can not receive sms's, he only gets marketing texts and Nedbank notifications meant for user that Vodacom assigned the number to prior to me/my son (I assume).  I have tried multiple times as mentioned before calling the call center but the options given by TOBI do not address this issue.<br /><br />I sent an email which seemed to attract a back and forth that required me to do authentication. The type of work I do and responsibilities at home as a mother, wife, daughter in-in-law does not allow me the luxury of leaving things unresolved the first time, hence I preferred calling but 135 (Tobi's play ground) has been unable to assist or give an option to speak to a live person who can hear and understand nuanced issues not pre-programed on Tobi.<br /><br />The number in question is **********.

Hopefully this will get their marketing departments attention:<br /><br />The adverti*****ts on Vodacom's website do not match the Vodacom brochure. <br /><br />When I click on \"callback\" I am presented with a website error. <br /><br />When I click on chat, I have to speak to a useless chatbot that does not present the options I am looking for. <br /><br />When I call custom service I am only given new phone numbers to call. Eventually I got hold of the contract department, but they seem to only have 1 agent who is completely clueless and don't even know what Vodacom is selling. I ask for property data package with a router he tells me they don't sell routers. I ask for a SIM only, he gives me the router packages?!? As ask for unlimited data,  he gives me the unlimited minutes package. I ask for data-only contract he tells me that is not possible for a home office, because he only sells Home Internet?!?

On a sailing trip to Namibia my phone fell overboard.<br /><br />I contacted vodacom as soon as we arrived to arrange for a sim swap. After many hours of talking with support, I was told the only way to do a sim swap was to purchase a new contract sim card and have it couriered to Namibia and then the swap could be done. I did so at great expense.<br /><br />I contacted Vodacom support again to complete the sim swap and I am now being told it is not possible! After all the costs and frustration the support agent refuses to assist and they keep referring me back to Tobi, Vodacoms robot assistant. I am fed up!<br /><br />Surelly I am not the first client to be stuck in a situation like this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The customer is frustrated with the support agent's refusal to assist and the reliance on the chatbot.                                                     |\n",

I am spending 100s of dollars making calls now and cannot get international roaming activated. <br /><br />Please email me to help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The customer is complaining about the virtual assistant Tobi.                                                                                              |\n",

I am very annoyed. I applied at your vodacom 4u Berea east london branch for a double up iPhone. Thr lady said they don't have stock of the phone but can put through 2 new additional lines on my current package. Long story short for some reason she said only 1 approved. I told her that I'm disappointed with vodacom for only approving 1 but I will then do the double up online. I told them to cancel the approval I'll do the double up online. I am now blocked doing it online as they have an approval and decline they need to uplift so I can do the online order on the double up. I have been a conract customer since 2007 and this has been by far the worse service I have received. <br /><br />Since this morning the branch is just ignoring me and my request to cancel. I am speaking to someone on your fb messagnger who seems to be a robot! I also see vodacom did 4 credit checks on me yesterday without my permission. <br /><br />I will be taking this further. I also want to know who I can contact to cancel my 5 packages I have and what needs to be paid so I may move to another network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The customer is complaining about the unhelpful response from the Vodacom Facebook Messenger.                                                              |\n",
      "| 329 | Vodacom online deals are a SCAM                                                                                                                                                          | This company may as well rename itself to Vodascam, or Voda****s, or something of that nature, because their ONLINE deals are not a reflection of their actual contract prices. Their stupid robot changed the order I made for my wife's phone the next morning, adding a whopping R120 to the monthly bill for exactly the same thing. We thought this was erroneous, so we ignored the SMS. We did not confirm it, but they shipped the order anyway. Then they shipped it to the wrong address. They refused to accept a third party delivery (a.k.a. Me, because my wife cannot receive deliveries during the day), even though my work address was already verified under her account as a 3rd party. This meant that we never even got the phone after a month of waiting. They wasted everyone's time, including the courier (RAM) who went to the same old address where she no longer lives, about 5 times. Upon phoning the after-sales number we got from a Vodacom shop employee, they told me she could change the delivery address over the phone, so I relayed this to my wife and told her to phone them. Then they told her that they can't. That's the point when they also told her that the contract we bought does not allow Top-Ups and is actually R419/pm instead of R299/pm as per the \"online exclusive\" - and that they will change out-of-bundle rates for going over 500MB/month, which is NOT WHAT A TOP-UP CONTRACT IS. But they defended themselves, because if you go onto their website, their description of top-up and normal contracts are exactly the same. Top-up now also bills you after you use your data. This company is scamming people with misleading advertising and wording and a stupid ****ing robot that is utterly useless. It's swallowed my airtime before expiry multiple times before, but that's another issue entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The customer is complaining about the chatbot's role in changing their order and providing incorrect information                                           |\n",

I don't know if I will ever get my money back or the things I have ordered 🤔                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The customer is complaining about the chatbot not being able to resolve their issue.                                                                       |\n",

MY ACCOUNT IS UP TO DATE I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING - except the monthly instalment of August 2022. Again I will not have money on the 22 August 2022, however I will make a payment via EFT does this mean that you will charge me R100,88 say that my account is in arrears?<br /><br />Which product am I paying for that I took with Vodacom for R100,88 or are you just  exploiting your customers for more money and justify it by saying that we didn't find money into your account on the debit order date.<br /><br />Please update my account with the correct balances - I don't owe you that money. Let's practice fair business - I made the payment, whether it's via EFT or debit order - payment was made.<br /><br />One more thing the BOT is very annoying, it calls all lines you have with VODACOM simultaneously and from my side that's harassment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The customer is complaining about receiving calls from a BOT, which they find annoying and consider harassment.                                            |\n",

How do I get rid of this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The customer is complaining about not being helped by the robot assistant.                                                                                 |\n",

I've tried everything - *135# for USSD self-help, SMS chatbot, WhatsApp chatbot, and even PHONING 135 to get assistance, where just another useless robot gives me NO WAY to get hold of a human and no relevant options to help me. An old post on your Twitter says dial *135*6#, but that is not relevant to cancelling recurring data bundles. So, I have one question: \"HOW DO I CANCEL A RECURRING 30-DAY DATA BUNDLE?\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The customer spent more than an hour trying to find a way to cancel a recurring data bundle but was unable to find any relevant options or assistance.     |\n",

Today finally swap my number back but now there was air time advanced of R200 done and transferred to another number which they can't help me find out or it's no appearing on their system. I'm told I'm liable to pay for the advance taken and transferred by the fraudsters. It was their useless TOBI that did the sim swap and I'm expected to bay for their **** up?? How does that work. I will not pay a cent to them. they must just get rid of Tobi the useless robot idiot and bring back my airtime balance of R149 that initially in my account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The customer complains that TOBI, the chatbot, was not helpful in stopping the sim swap                                                                    |\n",

Once i succeed in getting my number back, bye bye vodacom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The customer had a negative experience with Vodacom's chatbot                                                                                              |\n",

It's the next day today and still nothing. I called the million times and no operator picks up the phone. They make me chat to stupid Tobi who doesn't even have my options in the queries. I want to speak to a real person so that I can get my airtime.

I was the advised that my phone have been blacklisted. Frustrated I stayed calm, followed the instructions, completed the unblacklist form and sent it via email. The phone was blacklisted on Friday 14 Oct 2022, it is now a week later and still nothing, no reply on the numerous emails and the tobi bot is a absolute joke. Needless to say I am highly irritated as I had to leave my phone off for 48 hours, then another 48 hours and still ****all happened. I have been a loyal Vodacom customer for many many years. I use my phone for business purposes and can’t have it off for an entire week. Please assist ASAP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The Tobi bot is not providing helpful assistance                                                                                                           |\n",

How can it be so difficult to get an agent to speak to me?? I have been on the phone for over 30mins trying  different options, in hope that I will get an option to speak to a real human being, not this Tobi robot. Tobi can be very frustrated, he does not have all the options I want. Just to cancel an online application has taken me over 30mins. This is not right! we need the agent option still on the voice prompt. I am typing this and I am still on the phone waiting for an agent from the \"online\" department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The customer is frustrated with the limitations of the chatbot and the difficulty in reaching a human agent.                                               |\n",

It is disgraceful,  disgusting and utterly pathetic!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The customer is complaining about the chatbot Tobi and its inability to assist with their issue regarding expiring fuel vouchers.                          |\n",

Its like paying a game..... Every answer you give is like finishing a level on CandyCrush.<br /><br />Funny how you can speak to a human if you call for insurance or something they try sell to you. And how easily they contact you if there is a problem with payment on your account.<br /><br />But as soon as you require service... TOBI.... No option to speak to a real human so the option you want is never there.<br />Yippy you have a bot that can work on voice commands!!!

I commented on FB regarding their use of a bot and suddenly, after 5 days, they communicate again on Messenger. After a while asking my number - i give my number, thinking they want to check that i am who i am, and i got feeling to assist me. Then realised i have the nr i am using, they want my deleted nr. I gave that. Hour's after silence they say they still won't help. Why did they then want the number?

Their systems & procedures are rigged to only get access to your bank account and take your money. <br /><br />1 November 2022 I signed up for a new Data SIM on contract with Vodacom SA. After many! attempts for nearly 2 weeks to actually speak with someone on a call or email, their system just keeps pushing you into loops with their stupid \"Tobi\" robot that does not even have the intelligence to recognize your question. The package was delivered Thursday 10 Nov. But it was the wrong product. The SIM did not work in my mobile router as ordered. <br /><br />I could not get any answer from Vodacom via phone, email or Whatsapp system. Email auto reply says this channel is discontinued and to contact \"Tobi\" by phone or Whatsapp. On phone & Whatsapp, \"Tobi\" is programmed to tell you to email them. I even tried Twitter but those people could not even read simple English as they failed to answer to my actual question. Immediately Monday 14 Nov (3 days after SIM activation), I went in to their shop and there I was put in phone contact with an actual person. To fix the problem of the wrong product, they had to cancel the contract and collect the delivered product. <br /><br />I had to contact Vodacom again on 17 + 23 + 28 Nov because both the contract calcellation or the product collection has not been done yet. So the product was finally collected 30 Nov. <br /><br />But on 8 December I phoned Vodacom again to find out why I have not yet received the contract cancellation notice via email as I was told repeatedly. I only goy a voice recording that said \"Our call center detects a high number of calls from your number. Your number is blocked to protect the system from fraudulant activity. You have to call ********** / ********** @ R2.00/minute for further help.” SERIOUSLY!!! blocked for fraudulant activity!? <br /><br />On 9 Dec I called the same Vodacom Billing Support numbers using family members phone. After speaking with someone I spoke with on 17 Nov, she put me through to the \"cancellation dept\". There I was put through to someone else again. After having to explain EVERYTHING AGAIN and a very long conversation, this guy confirmed his job was just to GET ME TO BUY ANOTHER CONTRACT! He was not able to cancel the contract but he said \"did send an email to the \"cancellation dept\". <br /><br />At the shop they say they can not help me and I have to speak with those people on the phone. It just keeps going in circles and every time they lead you to *just another sales person* trying to sell you something.<br /><br />Today after 49 days Vodacom is still taking my money from my bank for this contract of an incorrect product which I do even not have any longer after they collected it from me.<br /><br />So what are we to do? How do we get Vodacom to actually deliver the product & service they sell us?<br />Can anyone help me please?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The chatbot 'Tobi' is not able to provide adequate assistance and keeps redirecting the customer                                                           |\n",
      "| 438 | Roaming not working despite activating prior to departure                                                                                                                                | Last week I went into the Vodacom branch at Mall at Reds and explained to them that I wanted to change from MTN due to issues I had been having. I explained that I work abroad and would need international roaming to be active to receive OTP's from my SA bank accounts. The consultant advised me this was easy to setup and reassured me that I can have international roaming on a Vodacom PAYG SIM card. I stressed to her the importance of needing this to work properly as I depended on it for conducting business back in SA while working abroad. After again being reassured by her that this would not be a problem, I purchased a new phone and SIM card, on a 'Power bonus' PAYG package. I followed her advice and activated international roaming by calling 082 135 and then using the Tobi SMS bot. I then rechecked before departure and again received SMS notification that Vodafone world roaming was indeed active. I have subsequently switched and updated all my banking and investment contact details to my new Vodacom number however, upon my arrival in the UK, I am unable to connect to any mobile network here. If I search manually, networks of the Vodacom roaming partners are available but all show 'forbidden' and prevent me from connecting. I cannot receive any calls or smses to my new Vodacom number. I have restarted my phone numerous times without. If I go on the Vodacom app it says I am ineligible for roaming but if I contact 'Tobi' via WhatsApp (using WiFi) it says that I am already setup for roaming with Vodafone World. I don't understand this discrepancy. I tried emailing customer care and was again referred to the chatbot Tobi which is useless as it keeps telling me I am already registered for roaming despite it not working. I need this resolved ASAP as I need to be able to access my internet banking and other financial institutions. I was promised by the consultant prior to sale that I would not have an issue with roaming yet here I am, stick without connectivity and needing to do business. I cannot be called on my Vodacom number and I cannot call the call centre either as I am already abroad and have no mobile network connectivity. I need someone to email me or call me on an alternative UK number to urgently activate my roaming!! Please help!!! I have been unable to reach Vodacom thus far!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The customer activated international roaming but is unable to connect to any mobile network in the UK                                                      |\n",

I had a call from Vodacom last month as my current package has “expired”. The consultant offered me a lower package at R400 with more data and of course I accepted as this is lower than I am currently paying. I received an sms this morning telling me that my premium is now almost R300 more that what I was advised. I have tried to contact Vodacom since before 8am on all platforms, from calling them to requesting call backs to trying to chat to ‘Lu****a Hlomza’ on the TOBi chat bot who ended the chat without responding to my query? <br /><br />After speaking to different consultants on 4 calls who promise to assist and escalate, I finally get through to a nice gent who transfers me through to after sales so that they are able to cancel this “package upgrade”. Knowing that they are likely short-staffed I gladly stay on hold for over an hour to have someone drop the call. As I’m typing this, this is probably my 6 or 7th call Nd I have been waiting for a consultant for 20 minutes already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The customer had a negative experience with the chat bot and did not receive a response to their query.                                                    |\n",

They are literally the most useless mobile company that I ever had to deal with and I am glad that I decided to move to another provider. Useless employees can't even assist you in one of their branches neither over the phone. I just wonder what they pay these people to do, they might as well let all of them go because the one is more useless than the other.<br />Here is what happened, I cancelled my contract earlier, I paid the settlement amount that they gave me, yet two years later on a credit report it shows I owe Vodacom money???? Yet again, two years ago after I sent the proof of payment the useless Vodacom staff could not do a simple task of updating this and sending me the settlement letter confirming that all is in order. Why are you even open Vodacom, it is very obvious that you want customer's money but do not want to assist the customers!!! Not to even talk about the rubbish chat bot that you trying to use. I spent half an hour trying to get someone to assist me, but they are probably sleeping and not yet again not doing their jobs!!! and by the way, IF you give an email on your useless chat bot to use, MAKE SURE IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The customer complains about the inefficiency and unresponsiveness of the chatbot.                                                                         |\n",

I made plans to take time off work to go in and make the payment required including the month ahead. I also inquired about converting my number to pay as you go. As happy as they were to take the money they immediately shut up shop and mentioned I'd have to get in queue and have a different person help me. I did not have time for that, so they said I could call a number for reconnection. That number gives you very little option, either for upgrade or a service bot. The whole time informing you of how they care. The service bot is so friggen useless. It said I would be rconected twice. This did not happen. It has been a whole day. I have turned off after an hour after each call as instructed and still nothing. I even lied and contacted someone about an upgrade, which I do qualify for and asked them to put me through to someone about reconnecting. They did... They promised to call back they didn't. The 4 times I have tried since then I have been hung up on all four times. I give up. Someone needs to contact me. I just want to have my phone connected again. I'm over the exhaustive ineptitude of your entire company. Once that is done, I want to covert my number to pay as you go. The lack of care and  malice from your staff is excruciatingly painful.

This is urgent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The customer is complaining about not being able to reach a Vodacom agent to report a stolen phone                                                         |\n",

They are thieves and continue taking my money months after I cancel my contract! My contract was due to expire end of December 2022, and I moved to Namibia in November 2022, so I stopped my contract at the end of October 2022 and paid the penalty for prematurely stopping the contract. I spoke with numerous agents and sent all the documentation to the cancellations department, where I got a response from the BOT saying that my early cancellation had been received. The problem is now, even after stopping the contract and paying the penalty, Vodacom is still taking money off my account. They took money, Nov, Dec and now JANUARY as well, which means that they - without my approval continued the contract!!! This company is a scam and has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! I need this matter resolved as soon as possible, and I would like the money taken from my account to be paid back!!!!!!! I am staying in Namibia now, and I can't get in contact with a real person other than a BOT. Please contact me via email to resolve this matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The customer is complaining about the chatbot's response regarding the cancellation and the continued deduction of money from their account.               |\n",
      "| 454 | Shameful service from a company big as Vodacom                                                                                                                                           | 7 days ago crimimals did a sim swap on phone through the stupid TOBI robot. An advance of R140 against my numbers was taken and transferred along with my airtime by the criminals to their numbers and vodacom promised to cancel the advance and a reference number was issued for my case, 7 days down the line I'm still owing the R140 advance nothing has been done to atleast cancel the advance, when i call their consultants they say i must wait 7 working days for feedback. I can't even access mobile banking because i dont have airtime and i can't  make fonecalls ,the least i expected vodacom to do was to expedite the advance <br />cancellation since it is their fault that this stupid TOBI technology is so weak that criminals are now able to manipulate it to do sim swaps, but no im told to wait 7 working days for feedback. I am not going to buy back that advance from my own pocket for their fault, never. I wish i could switch to other networks,  it's a pity that im stuck with this useless network because most of my things are linked to my vodacom numbers,  but one day things will change.

I have logged a case with both @VodacomSA and @TymebankZA, it almost a month now, and none of them are taking my case serious, I have to do follow ups with them, they always promise to get back to me before end of business day and those promises are not fulfilled thus far. I have answered all the questions they asked 😭😭😭. I have been using this number since 2009. I am very frustrated, and this is affecting my work, very angry it is affecting my life, my family, I am very very disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Vodacom's ChatBot TOBI authorized a simswap without customer's permission                                                                                  |\n",

My mistake. After debiting my account correctly the first month, they subsequently doubled my debit amount in the second month. After calling them 3 times - being promised call backs by two agents and having one agent tell me he would transfer my call but dropped the call instead - I am gatvol. I just want my refund! How difficult can this be????? Also, your chatbot is silly - I have a data sim. It sent a pin to the data sim which is in a router. How do I get the pin to verify who I am?????                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The customer complained about the chatbot's inability to assist with verifying their identity.                                                             |\n",

When I went to my next Vodacom branch at De Ville Centre in Durbanville Central on February 22 at 11.15 the shop assistant was rude and quarrelsome. After some arguing I got him to delete the welcome tone. For my claim to be refunded I was given the Vodacom Customer Care telephone number. On that number I did not find any option for complaints and was talking to their chat bot only.  I still do not know how to get to them for my claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The customer had difficulty finding the option for complaints and was only able to interact with the chatbot                                               |\n",

I imediatly phoned Vodacom customer care and strugled to a point where I eventually got connected to a Agent....well I think it was an Agent. She strugled to understand plain English but I got through to her and she said she reversed the the sim swap and flaged my number for future sim swaps. Then the BOMB. the sim swap went through!!!!!! How the hell did that happen????? I used my daughters phone to phone customer care again as soon as I realized that the network was not down its my number that's not working. Now this is where things get weird. I had the best experience with the Agent that help me this time.....I think his name was Kabelo. He spoke A grade english and helped me with ease. He checked my number but could find no evidence of me phoning in that afternoon( How the hell is that possible?) He assisted in giving me relevant information and reversed the sim swap at the speed of light. Very satisfying service from him. He also flagged my number so that no sim swaps could be done without ID verification. Now I wonder and red flags are flaring up in my head.....This had to be a inside job from vodacom. 1. The sim swap was done using the useless TOBI BOT.<br />2. All the security questions was verrified.<br />3. After reverising the sim swap the first time it was set to still go through.<br />4. No records of me phoning in the first time to do the reversal.<br />5. My bank acount was emptied in the time my number was off and I hold Vodacom pesonnally responsible for this.<br /><br />I remember when I was working for vodacom the Security was very strict on sim swaps. How did Vodacom sink so low as to let a robot do a sim swap?<br /><br />Vodacom realy has to revise their sim swap procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The complaint is about the sim swap process and the use of the chatbot for the sim swap.                                                                   |\n",

All i am trying to do is speak to someone (a human, not a robot)to help me explain why my bill is so high. i cannot understand why something so simple is becoming a very hard and frustrating ordeal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The customer is complaining about the unhelpfulness of the chatbot and the difficulty in reaching a human representative.                                  |\n",

I need the new SIM card to be activated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The customer is complaining about the chatbot not being helpful in activating their new SIM card                                                           |\n",

I have no dealings whatsoever with Vodacom and don't intend in having a cellphone contract with them. It's difficult to get hold of them using their customer care line, I spent almost 40 minutes and there's no option to speak to a human being. The chat bot is the worst I have ever come across.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The customer complained about the chatbot's performance.                                                                                                   |\n",

On Sunday, 28th of May 2023, Vodacom deleted my sim card which has been active for the past 6 years and was last active on the 27th of May 2023 at 22:00 loaded with airtime and data of R600-00. I contacted Vodacom Tobi Chatbot, it simply gave me an unhelpful answer. I then contacted the Vodacom customer care line, and the answering machine said \"Enter the number you are querying\". After I entered the number, it answered: \"We can't recognize your number\". There was not even an opportunity to talk to an agent. I then contacted Vodacom support on Twitter. The machine on Twitter was as unhelpful as Tobi the Chatbot. The Vodacom support simply said, \"The number has been deleted because inactive sim cards are deleted as per Vodacom policy. Then it sends me the link to the Vodacom terms and conditions website. <br />All the numbers which Vodacom provided were just so unhelpful and left me frustrated because I was spending almost R1000-00 every month on Vodacom services. <br />Tobia CHatbot is a horrible Vodacom support and so is their Twitter Support.<br />I can imagine how many sim cards are erroneously deleted by Vodacom and people who forfeit their data and airtime because of such bad customer support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The customer complained about the unhelpful response from Vodacom Tobi Chatbot.                                                                            |\n",

After initial vetting etc. a Vodacom agent called her and indicated that she 'did not qualify for that deal' but did qualify for a significantly more expensive deal offering more data etc. for this cellphone. When she indicated that she was not interested in the extra data etc. and would like the advertised deal, the agent offered her a cheaper deal for a lower end phone, which she declined.<br /><br />I phone Vodacom to enquire how it is possible that someone do not qualify for a cheaper deal, but do qualify for a more expensive deal the agent indicated that they will only discuss the matter with my wife.<br /><br />Consequently I sent an email to customer care which came back indicating that I should use the TOBI chat bot to contact them.

I still haven't received it, and it's impossible to phone Vodacom from a non-Vodacom sim card, you get a bot and no one to speak to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The customer is complaining about the inability to speak to a person and the delay in receiving an ITC Number                                              |\n",

The fact that it was bypassed and Vodacom allowed it makes it *****ulent. We want all airtime taken reversed. When sending query to customer care, we are forced to chat to Tobi the robot instead of human. How can you explain the query to a robot? Is it because this is a prepaid number?

Cheap ROBOT, but they can't support the real people with jobs who support them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The customer is complaining about the use of a chatbot instead of real people for customer support.                                                        |\n",

These bots that answer their phones are just a barrier that they are creating to rip people off. I'm trying to get an itemized bill for my vodacom account because they are billing me almost twice the amount that I signed up for. So yes I paid but I sent an email with clarity seeking questions more than a week ago, to date they have not rep****. I'm trying to call their customer care line and it's only bots that answer the phone and there's just no call centre agent available because their lines are just \"too busy\" according to these bots .. Really??? Its laughable. <br /><br />What is it with these network businesses? Its not the first time i experience this, i moved to vodacom thinking that I'd get better service and I'm grossly disappointed, when you're billed more than you signed  up for  there must at least be an explanation. In the absence of an explanation, it is THEFT. You sell a package that the consumer is comfortable to pay then suddenly you bill them for twice this amount, when they seek an explanation you are simply nowhere to be found. When Vodacom sells you products, they don't send bots to talk to you but when a client wants to query a bill, they have bots on the line. This is unacceptable. If this persists, we will have to establish an online campaign against vodacom on all social media platforms. Consumers cannot continue to be ********** like this! It's not right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The customer is complaining about the use of bots to answer calls and the lack of availability of customer care agents                                     |\n",

They just say \" high call volumes\", and put you through to their stupid chatbot that is useless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The customer is complaining about the chatbot being useless and not able to provide assistance.                                                            |\n",

I did not like the model and wanted to return it within the 7 day cooling off period. No one in the call center can help me return the cellphone yet they offer the service only to contract clients. I went to a Vodacom4u and no one can help there either. I tried the Chatbot and Samantha Sinegugu McHunu was supposed to be assisting me however there is no reply from her after explaining my situation. This has has to be the worst service i have received from them in all the year i have been with Vodacom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The customer complained about not receiving a reply from the chatbot after explaining their situation.                                                     |\n",

Obviously. I however immediately entered into a payment arrangement via their TOBI bot on Whatsapp (screenshots will confirm same). Today I was service blocked despite such payment arrangement because to no surprise the payment arrangement through the bot does not reflect on their system. What is the use of the bot or the payment arrangement then? The 2nd time in as many weeks that I had absolutely horrific service from vodacom and I am seriously contemplating terminating my relationship with them! Making calls is an integral part of my day to day work duties, which now came to a halt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The customer entered into a payment arrangement via the TOBI bot, but it did not reflect on Vodacom's system                                               |\n",

What a useless piece of technology.  I would like to rather speak to a human and not some computer.  I had a problem with my phone and after going through the whole answer system, instead of getting an agent to help me, I am routed to Tobi.  Again we go through a whole lot of questions.  Then Tobi tell me that he is unable to help me and asks if I would like to speak to an agent.  I confirm with a \"yes\" and Tobi responds with \"you have chosen the self help option\".  Totally not what I have chosen and we start again.  Because choosing to speak to an Agent previously haven't helped, I now chose not to speak to an Agent.  Thinking that maybe Tobi is a bit confused.  So I say \"no\".  To which Tobi replies \"I am unable to help you at this stage.  Goodbye\".  Frustrating to no measure.  Vodacom, if you are going to go the automated route, make sure it actually works.

I called Vodacom Westgate to findout how it works and I was told I need to contact customer service or come to the shop if it fails. I called 082135 but couldn't get to speak to the consultant to get assistance. Everything was a bot that couldn't understand my needs. I then went to the shop where a gentleman tried to help me. He got the QR printed and everything done but nothing worked. I paid and everything then his colleague came and said I must leave everything will work after 4 hours. It is now more than 12 hours and I'm still getting errors when I scan the QR code. I'm employed and I can't return to the shop cos they also do not seem to understand this process. Can't call Vodacom cos I will be directed to the bot hence I came here for help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The customer had difficulty getting assistance from the chatbot and had to go to the shop for help with their eSim activation.                             |\n",
      "| 552 | USELESS options and even more useless \"BOT\" to try and solve your problem!!!                                                                                                             | Their webmail7 Suddenly doesn't work anymore. When you want to enter through their vodacom site and can't remember your password as you haven't use it for YEARS, they send you a password reset or something to your email adress BUT YOUR EMAIL DOESN'T WORK, so how on earth do you access it? When you phone their customer number, ANY OPTION YOU CHOOSE SEND YOU TO THEIR USELESS ROBOT and when you want to talk to an agent, you must register a certain voice notification **** and say a specific sentence.  Well I've said that sentence FOUR times and every time I say it, it was wrong? I said it slow, I said it normal and even word for word, but nothing works.

On the 14th I called customer service but was referred to TOBI the BOT, of which it was hard for TOBI to understand because he is an Automated Machine, I then asked to speak to a human, with no success. Sent an email to customer care, got a reference but no call back. I went to Sandton branch, but they could not help me because I bought the data online via capitec app. Can we please speak to humans, its really tiring not being able to express yourself. Kindly serve your customers well, this is really frustrating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The customer is tired of speaking to TOBI the BOT and wants to speak to a human.                                                                           |\n"
