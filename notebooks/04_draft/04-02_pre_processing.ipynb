    "\n",
    "This study investigates customer satisfaction levels and preferences around using artificial intelligence-driven technologies in the telecommunications industry. The rapid advancement in AI has led to tools such as chatbots becoming an integral part of customer service, and while AI-driven technologies can offer personalised and efficient solutions that significantly increase client satisfaction rates, studying the effectiveness and impact of these technologies remains a critical area of investigation.\n",

    "### 1. (b) Background and context\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted industries, including telecommunications, ranging from finance, healthcare and manufacturing, all potentially disrupted by these technologies (Dwivedi et al., 2021). For example, AI plays an essential role in today’s telecommunications industry, where it can make predictions about decisions, use big data to offer solutions and interact with customers in real-time via conversational agents (Sardjono et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-driven technologies such as chatbots, process automation, and automated customer support systems are transforming customer service from human-driven to technology-dominant (Castillo et al., 2021). This transformation offers many advantages, such as improving efficiency, reducing cost and enhancing the customer experience through personalised user interactions. For example, chatbots can handle routing queries and allow their human counterparts to focus on complex, high-value issues. However, as discussed by (Castillo et al., 2021), these technologies can also fail and have negative consequences leading to customer confusion, anger and dissatisfaction, and as mentioned in the introduction, studying the impact and effectiveness of these tools remains critical."

    "1.\tEvaluate overall satisfaction among customers towards their telecommunication customer service encounters while concurrently identifying the elements behind positive and negative experiences.\n",
    "2.\tInvestigate customer perception of AI-based service tools like chatbots and assess their effectiveness in offering efficient and personalised customer service.\n",

    "Potential impact:\n",
    "1.\tImproving customer service strategies: By understanding customer preferences and experiences, telecommunications companies can identify areas to focus on where AI-based tools can provide the most significant value.\n",
    "2.\tBoosting customer satisfaction and loyalty: Based on the trends identified in this study, telecommunications companies can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty by enhancing their existing customer service tools.\n",
    "3.\tEncouraging AI-driven customer service tool adoption: This study seeks to understand factors limiting the adoption of AI tools. These findings may help telecommunications companies better promote AI-driven customer service tools, improving customer experiences and reducing workloads for customer service representatives.\n",
    "4.\tInforming industry practices: The output of this study will contribute to a broader understanding of customer satisfaction and preferences in the telecommunications industry. These insights can prove valuable when designing practices to improve customer service."

    "\n",
    "The target population for this study is the five major South African telecommunications providers, namely Cell C, MTN, Rain, Telkom, and Vodacom. Ideally, stratified random sampling should be used to get a representative sample from each provider according to their market size. Unfortunately, this will not be possible due to budget and time constraints. Instead, snowball sampling will be employed by asking for respondents on social media platforms and requesting the initial respondents to refer other customers within their social network who might be interested in participating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using snowball sampling is likely to result in some selection bias. To minimise the impact, should the data indicate, for example, that respondents are primarily from a single provider, the scope will be narrowed to focus on this provider, reducing the extent to which findings can be generalised."

    "\n",
    "1.\tHow does customer satisfaction with a telecommunications provider’s customer service differ by the various demographic groups? \n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale: According to some studies (Kassim, 2006; Saha* & Joshi, 2019), demographic factors such as age, gender and marital status can have a significant effect on perceptions of performance and satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tHow do customers perceive the effectiveness and level of personalisation offered by AI-driven customer service tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale: AI-driven tools have become increasingly popular in customer service with the promise of reduced labour costs. However, some consumers resist tools like chatbots (Li et al., 2020) and prefer traditional human-based customer service. Therefore, it is essential to understand this aspect and find ways to improve adaptation rates and trust in AI-driven tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tIs there a relationship between customer satisfaction and using AI-driven customer service tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale: Understanding the correlation can help business improve their customer service strategies and ultimately improve customer loyalty and retention (Chen et al., 2021; Ganguli & Roy, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tBased on insights gathered in the survey and comparing it with online complaint behaviour, what are the critical areas for improvement in customer service within the telecommunications industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "By analysing the trends from the survey data in conjunction with customer complaints from platforms such as Hellopeter (Foulds, 2022), we aim to discover actionable insights that will assist telecommunications in finding key focus areas to improve customer service through AI-driven tools. \n"

    "The initial section of our survey comprises a few questions intended to gather basic demographic information from our participants. These questions are relatively simple and require minimal commitment and thus may motivate participation by making respondents feel more comfortable with providing their input. Next, a series of questions are asked about the respondent’s telecommunications provider to set the context for the rest of the survey.
