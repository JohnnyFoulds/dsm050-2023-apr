| 2023-07-20 15:05:44              | vodacom              | Tired of speaking to TOBI, we need humans | I bought WhatsApp bundles for R35 on the 13th July 2023, which have not been allocated till today the 20th, but i was rewarded with 3.5 Vodabucks. On the 14th I called customer service but was referred to TOBI the BOT, of which it was hard for TOBI to understand because he is an Automated Machine, I then asked to speak to a human, with no success. Sent an email to customer care, got a reference but no call back. I went to Sandton branch, but they could not help me because I bought the data online via capitec app. Can we please speak to humans, its really tiring not being able to express yourself. Kindly serve your customers well, this is really frustrating.              | Customer dissatisfaction with chatbot              | The customer is tired of speaking to TOBI the BOT and wants to speak to a human.              | Improve the chatbot's ability to understand customer queries and provide an option for customers to speak to a human when needed.              | WhatsApp bundles              | The customer bought WhatsApp bundles but they have not been allocated.

| 2023-07-19 08:06:30              | vodacom              | USELESS options and even more useless "BOT" to try and solve your problem!!! | Their webmail7 Suddenly doesn't work anymore. When you want to enter through their vodacom site and can't remember your password as you haven't use it for YEARS, they send you a password reset or something to your email adress BUT YOUR EMAIL DOESN'T WORK, so how on earth do you access it? When you phone their customer number, ANY OPTION YOU CHOOSE SEND YOU TO THEIR USELESS ROBOT and when you want to talk to an agent, you must register a certain voice notification **** and say a specific sentence.  Well I've said that sentence FOUR times and every time I say it, it was wrong? I said it slow, I said it normal and even word for word, but nothing works. SO HOW DO YOU GET TO TALK TO AN AGENT AND NOT THEIR USELESS ROBOT WHICH DOESN'T HAVE THE OPTION WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING FOR?              | Customer service              | The customer is complaining about the inability to talk to a human agent and the frustration with the chatbot              | Improve the chatbot's recognition of voice notifications and provide a direct option to talk to a human agent              | Webmail7              | The customer is unable to access their email through the Vodacom site and cannot reset their password              | Fix the issue with the email service and provide alternative methods for password reset              |
| 2023-07-18 06:44:51              | vodacom              | Vodacom eSim | I got myself an iPhone and someone told me about the esim to avoid carrying 2 phones. I called Vodacom Westgate to findout how it works and I was told I need to contact customer service or come to the shop if it fails. I called 082135 but couldn't get to speak to the consultant to get assistance. Everything was a bot that couldn't understand my needs. I then went to the shop where a gentleman tried to help me. He got the QR printed and everything done but nothing worked. I paid and everything then his colleague came and said I must leave everything will work after 4 hours. It is now more than 12 hours and I'm still getting errors when I scan the QR code. I'm employed and I can't return to the shop cos they also do not seem to understand this process. Can't call Vodacom cos I will be directed to the bot hence I came here for help.              | Customer service              | The customer had difficulty getting assistance from the chatbot and had to go to the shop for help with their eSim activation.              | Improve the chatbot's ability to understand customer needs and provide appropriate assistance for eSim activation.              | Vodacom eSim              | The customer tried to activate their eSim but encountered errors after following the instructions provided by the shop.

| 2023-07-16 14:28:00              | vodacom              | VODACOMS TOBI IS USELESS | Vodacom had decided to go automated and created their Chatbot Tobi.  What a useless piece of technology.  I would like to rather speak to a human and not some computer.  I had a problem with my phone and after going through the whole answer system, instead of getting an agent to help me, I am routed to Tobi.  Again we go through a whole lot of questions.  Then Tobi tell me that he is unable to help me and asks if I would like to speak to an agent.  I confirm with a "yes" and Tobi responds with "you have chosen the self help option".  Totally not what I have chosen and we start again.  Because choosing to speak to an Agent previously haven't helped, I now chose not to speak to an Agent.  Thinking that maybe Tobi is a bit confused.  So I say "no".  To which Tobi replies "I am unable to help you at this stage.  Goodbye".  Frustrating to no measure.  Vodacom, if you are going to go the automated route, make sure it actually works.

| 2023-06-22 16:41:12              | vodacom              | Bad bad service | A very useless call center, talking to a robot.

| 2023-06-22 07:33:15              | mtn              | Appalling service | MTN, in my experience, has to rate as probably the very worst service provider I have ever had the misfortune to deal with, and right up there with Telkom and ADT. Without going into specifics, because it would take too long, MTN, for me, incorporates huge difficulty in speaking to a human to start with, then it is almost impossible to speak to the right human amongst calls being misdirected, those on the receiving end having conflicting information or supplying no information, and then, after applying tenacity of an almost impossible degree, amongst dropped calls, to be told that someone would definitely come back to me as the problem has been escalated, and then deathly silence. Let's go 135 again and set aside a day, I say. After three hours I valiantly admit defeat. You win, MTN. I need to now extricate myself from a debit order and change service providers which should take possibly another two or three days of effort. However, MTN, you will receive the very worst feedback from me to everyone I know, unfortunately. I have no doubt that this email will either be ignored or I will get an AI bot asking me for my name and number and to explain my problem.              | Customer service              | The customer is complaining about the difficulty in speaking to a human and receiving conflicting or no information              | Improve the customer service by ensuring that calls are properly directed and that accurate information is provided to customers              | MTN              | The customer describes MTN as one of the worst service providers they have dealt with, mentioning difficulty in speaking to a human, misdirected calls, conflicting information, and lack of follow-up              | Address the customer's specific issues and improve the overall service quality to prevent similar complaints in the future              |
| 2023-06-20 19:48:36              | vodacom              | VODACOM AGAIN | Vodacom deducted unauthorised debit orders, which I reversed. Obviously. I however immediately entered into a payment arrangement via their TOBI bot on Whatsapp (screenshots will confirm same). Today I was service blocked despite such payment arrangement because to no surprise the payment arrangement through the bot does not reflect on their system. What is the use of the bot or the payment arrangement then? The 2nd time in as many weeks that I had absolutely horrific service from vodacom and I am seriously contemplating terminating my relationship with them! Making calls is an integral part of my day to day work duties, which now came to a halt.              | Customer service              | The customer entered into a payment arrangement via the TOBI bot, but it did not reflect on Vodacom's system              | Improve the integration between the TOBI bot and the payment system to ensure accurate and up-to-date information              | Vodacom              | Vodacom deducted unauthorised debit orders and despite entering into a payment arrangement via the TOBI bot, the customer was still service blocked              | Ensure that payment arrangements made through the TOBI bot are properly reflected on the system to avoid service disruptions              |
| 2023-06-13 11:36:47              | vodacom              | Cash Purchase on the Vodacom E Store | I purchased a cellphone on the E Shop. I did not like the model and wanted to return it within the 7 day cooling off period. No one in the call center can help me return the cellphone yet they offer the service only to contract clients. I went to a Vodacom4u and no one can help there either. I tried the Chatbot and Samantha Sinegugu McHunu was supposed to be assisting me however there is no reply from her after explaining my situation. This has has to be the worst service i have received from them in all the year i have been with Vodacom.              | Customer service              | The customer complained about not receiving a reply from the chatbot after explaining their situation.              | Improve the chatbot's responsiveness and ensure that customers receive timely assistance.              | Vodacom E Store              | The customer purchased a cellphone on the E Shop but wanted to return it within the 7-day cooling off period.

| 2023-06-08 15:16:50              | vodacom              | Terrible service at Vodacom. | I was phoned and offered  a new contract with more data. I accepted and thid was  to start on 1st June 2023.   Since 1st June, I have not been able to usa or access any data.   My account says I have 20Gb available. It is absolutely impossible to speak to any human at Vodacom. They just say " high call volumes", and put you through to their stupid chatbot that is useless.              | Complaint about chatbot functionality              | The customer is complaining about the chatbot being useless and not able to provide assistance.              | Improve the chatbot's functionality and ability to assist customers.              | Vodacom              | The customer received terrible service from Vodacom.

| 2023-06-08 13:37:55              | vodacom              | VODACOM AVOIDS CONSUMER QUERIES BY USING ROBOTS TO ANSWER CALLS... | Vodacom is unbelievably unavailable when customers have queries. These bots that answer their phones are just a barrier that they are creating to rip people off. I'm trying to get an itemized bill for my vodacom account because they are billing me almost twice the amount that I signed up for. So yes I paid but I sent an email with clarity seeking questions more than a week ago, to date they have not rep****. I'm trying to call their customer care line and it's only bots that answer the phone and there's just no call centre agent available because their lines are just "too busy" according to these bots .. Really??? Its laughable. <br /><br />What is it with these network businesses? Its not the first time i experience this, i moved to vodacom thinking that I'd get better service and I'm grossly disappointed, when you're billed more than you signed  up for  there must at least be an explanation. In the absence of an explanation, it is THEFT. You sell a package that the consumer is comfortable to pay then suddenly you bill them for twice this amount, when they seek an explanation you are simply nowhere to be found. When Vodacom sells you products, they don't send bots to talk to you but when a client wants to query a bill, they have bots on the line. This is unacceptable. If this persists, we will have to establish an online campaign against vodacom on all social media platforms. Consumers cannot continue to be ********** like this! It's not right.              | Customer service              | The customer is complaining about the use of bots to answer calls and the lack of availability of customer care agents              | Improve availability of customer care agents and provide a more efficient way for customers to get assistance              | Vodacom              | The customer is complaining about being billed almost twice the amount they signed up for and the lack of response to their email              | Provide an explanation for the increased billing and improve response time to customer queries              |
| 2023-06-08 11:27:24              | vodacom              | WHY VODACOM? | Why do our call charges go up and up, when we have to battle to talk to a robot when we have a problem with using Vodacom???? On what is Vodacom spending the money on because they cannot afford real people anymore? Cheap ROBOT, but they can't support the real people with jobs who support them?              | Customer service              | The customer is complaining about the use of a chatbot instead of real people for customer support.              | Improve the chatbot by making it more efficient and effective in resolving customer issues, or consider providing the option for customers to speak with a real person if needed.              | Vodacom              | The customer is unhappy with the call charges increasing and the use of a chatbot for customer support.              | Invest in improving customer service by providing better call charge plans and ensuring availability of real people for customer support.              |
| 2023-06-07 20:39:22              | vodacom              | Content service activated | Content services was activated on the number while we blocked all on the app. As a result have been loosing airtime everyday because of that. The fact that it was bypassed and Vodacom allowed it makes it *****ulent. We want all airtime taken reversed. When sending query to customer care, we are forced to chat to Tobi the robot instead of human. How can you explain the query to a robot? Is it because this is a prepaid number? Please contact my dad and refund him his airtime used for this content service. I deactivate it on the app again as it was definitely active.              | Customer support              | The customer is complaining about being forced to chat with a robot instead of a human              | Improve the customer support system to provide better assistance from human agents              | Content service              | The customer's content service was activated without their consent and they have been losing airtime as a result              | Reverse all airtime charges related to the content service and ensure it is deactivated properly              |
| 2023-06-05 09:53:46              | vodacom              | Impossible service | I phoned Vodacom on Wednesday night to block a line and get an ITC Number. I was promised it would take maximum 24 hours.

| 2023-06-02 08:21:15              | vodacom              | Vodacom online deals seem to not be available as advertised? | After spending a lot of time considering her options, my wife app**** for an advertised online deal for a Samsung A34 at R349 per month. After initial vetting etc. a Vodacom agent called her and indicated that she 'did not qualify for that deal' but did qualify for a significantly more expensive deal offering more data etc. for this cellphone. When she indicated that she was not interested in the extra data etc. and would like the advertised deal, the agent offered her a cheaper deal for a lower end phone, which she declined.<br /><br />I phone Vodacom to enquire how it is possible that someone do not qualify for a cheaper deal, but do qualify for a more expensive deal the agent indicated that they will only discuss the matter with my wife.<br /><br />Consequently I sent an email to customer care which came back indicating that I should use the TOBI chat bot to contact them. TOBI could obviously not answer my question.<br /><br />We decided to rather opt for another service provider....              | Customer care              | The customer tried to contact Vodacom customer care through the TOBI chat bot but was unable to get a satisfactory answer.              | Improve the TOBI chat bot to provide better assistance and address customer queries effectively.              | Vodacom online deals              | The customer applied for an advertised online deal for a Samsung A34 at R349 per month but was told that they did not qualify for that deal.

| 2023-05-31 19:52:52              | vodacom              | Vodacom Horrible Customer Care Service-Deleted Active SImcard | Vodacom had a sim card policy to delete a sim card that is inactive for a period of 120 days. On Sunday, 28th of May 2023, Vodacom deleted my sim card which has been active for the past 6 years and was last active on the 27th of May 2023 at 22:00 loaded with airtime and data of R600-00. I contacted Vodacom Tobi Chatbot, it simply gave me an unhelpful answer. I then contacted the Vodacom customer care line, and the answering machine said "Enter the number you are querying". After I entered the number, it answered: "We can't recognize your number". There was not even an opportunity to talk to an agent. I then contacted Vodacom support on Twitter. The machine on Twitter was as unhelpful as Tobi the Chatbot. The Vodacom support simply said, "The number has been deleted because inactive sim cards are deleted as per Vodacom policy. Then it sends me the link to the Vodacom terms and conditions website. <br />All the numbers which Vodacom provided were just so unhelpful and left me frustrated because I was spending almost R1000-00 every month on Vodacom services. <br />Tobia CHatbot is a horrible Vodacom support and so is their Twitter Support.<br />I can imagine how many sim cards are erroneously deleted by Vodacom and people who forfeit their data and airtime because of such bad customer support.              | Poor customer support              | The customer complained about the unhelpful response from Vodacom Tobi Chatbot.              | Improve the chatbot's ability to provide helpful and accurate responses.              | Vodacom              | The customer's sim card was deleted despite being active and loaded with airtime and data.

I imediatly phoned Vodacom customer care and strugled to a point where I eventually got connected to a Agent....well I think it was an Agent. She strugled to understand plain English but I got through to her and she said she reversed the the sim swap and flaged my number for future sim swaps. Then the BOMB. the sim swap went through!!!!!! How the hell did that happen????? I used my daughters phone to phone customer care again as soon as I realized that the network was not down its my number that's not working. Now this is where things get weird. I had the best experience with the Agent that help me this time.....I think his name was Kabelo. He spoke A grade english and helped me with ease. He checked my number but could find no evidence of me phoning in that afternoon( How the hell is that possible?) He assisted in giving me relevant information and reversed the sim swap at the speed of light. Very satisfying service from him. He also flagged my number so that no sim swaps could be done without ID verification. Now I wonder and red flags are flaring up in my head.....This had to be a inside job from vodacom. 1. The sim swap was done using the useless TOBI BOT.<br />2. All the security questions was verrified.<br />3. After reverising the sim swap the first time it was set to still go through.<br />4. No records of me phoning in the first time to do the reversal.<br />5.

An advance of R140 against my numbers was taken and transferred along with my airtime by the criminals to their numbers and vodacom promised to cancel the advance and a reference number was issued for my case, 7 days down the line I'm still owing the R140 advance nothing has been done to atleast cancel the advance, when i call their consultants they say i must wait 7 working days for feedback. I can't even access mobile banking because i dont have airtime and i can't  make fonecalls ,the least i expected vodacom to do was to expedite the advance <br />cancellation since it is their fault that this stupid TOBI technology is so weak that criminals are now able to manipulate it to do sim swaps, but no im told to wait 7 working days for feedback. I am not going to buy back that advance from my own pocket for their fault, never. I wish i could switch to other networks,  it's a pity that im stuck with this useless network because most of my things are linked to my vodacom numbers,  but one day things will change.

My contract was due to expire end of December 2022, and I moved to Namibia in November 2022, so I stopped my contract at the end of October 2022 and paid the penalty for prematurely stopping the contract. I spoke with numerous agents and sent all the documentation to the cancellations department, where I got a response from the BOT saying that my early cancellation had been received. The problem is now, even after stopping the contract and paying the penalty, Vodacom is still taking money off my account. They took money, Nov, Dec and now JANUARY as well, which means that they - without my approval continued the contract!!! This company is a scam and has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! I need this matter resolved as soon as possible, and I would like the money taken from my account to be paid back!!!!!!! I am staying in Namibia now, and I can't get in contact with a real person other than a BOT.

I made plans to take time off work to go in and make the payment required including the month ahead. I also inquired about converting my number to pay as you go. As happy as they were to take the money they immediately shut up shop and mentioned I'd have to get in queue and have a different person help me. I did not have time for that, so they said I could call a number for reconnection. That number gives you very little option, either for upgrade or a service bot. The whole time informing you of how they care. The service bot is so friggen useless. It said I would be rconected twice. This did not happen. It has been a whole day. I have turned off after an hour after each call as instructed and still nothing. I even lied and contacted someone about an upgrade, which I do qualify for and asked them to put me through to someone about reconnecting. They did... They promised to call back they didn't. The 4 times I have tried since then I have been hung up on all four times. I give up. Someone needs to contact me. I just want to have my phone connected again. I'm over the exhaustive ineptitude of your entire company. Once that is done, I want to covert my number to pay as you go. The lack of care and  malice from your staff is excruciatingly painful.

I had a call from Vodacom last month as my current package has “expired”. The consultant offered me a lower package at R400 with more data and of course I accepted as this is lower than I am currently paying. I received an sms this morning telling me that my premium is now almost R300 more that what I was advised. I have tried to contact Vodacom since before 8am on all platforms, from calling them to requesting call backs to trying to chat to ‘Lu****a Hlomza’ on the TOBi chat bot who ended the chat without responding to my query? <br /><br />After speaking to different consultants on 4 calls who promise to assist and escalate, I finally get through to a nice gent who transfers me through to after sales so that they are able to cancel this “package upgrade”. Knowing that they are likely short-staffed I gladly stay on hold for over an hour to have someone drop the call.

| 2022-12-19 23:47:19              | vodacom              | Roaming not working despite activating prior to departure | Last week I went into the Vodacom branch at Mall at Reds and explained to them that I wanted to change from MTN due to issues I had been having. I explained that I work abroad and would need international roaming to be active to receive OTP's from my SA bank accounts. The consultant advised me this was easy to setup and reassured me that I can have international roaming on a Vodacom PAYG SIM card. I stressed to her the importance of needing this to work properly as I depended on it for conducting business back in SA while working abroad. After again being reassured by her that this would not be a problem, I purchased a new phone and SIM card, on a 'Power bonus' PAYG package. I followed her advice and activated international roaming by calling 082 135 and then using the Tobi SMS bot. I then rechecked before departure and again received SMS notification that Vodafone world roaming was indeed active. I have subsequently switched and updated all my banking and investment contact details to my new Vodacom number however, upon my arrival in the UK, I am unable to connect to any mobile network here. If I search manually, networks of the Vodacom roaming partners are available but all show 'forbidden' and prevent me from connecting. I cannot receive any calls or smses to my new Vodacom number. I have restarted my phone numerous times without. If I go on the Vodacom app it says I am ineligible for roaming but if I contact 'Tobi' via WhatsApp (using WiFi) it says that I am already setup for roaming with Vodafone World. I don't understand this discrepancy. I tried emailing customer care and was again referred to the chatbot Tobi which is useless as it keeps telling me I am already registered for roaming despite it not working. I need this resolved ASAP as I need to be able to access my internet banking and other financial institutions. I was promised by the consultant prior to sale that I would not have an issue with roaming yet here I am, stick without connectivity and needing to do business. I cannot be called on my Vodacom number and I cannot call the call centre either as I am already abroad and have no mobile network connectivity. I need someone to email me or call me on an alternative UK number to urgently activate my roaming!! Please help!!!

Their systems & procedures are rigged to only get access to your bank account and take your money. <br /><br />1 November 2022 I signed up for a new Data SIM on contract with Vodacom SA. After many! attempts for nearly 2 weeks to actually speak with someone on a call or email, their system just keeps pushing you into loops with their stupid "Tobi" robot that does not even have the intelligence to recognize your question. The package was delivered Thursday 10 Nov. But it was the wrong product. The SIM did not work in my mobile router as ordered. <br /><br />I could not get any answer from Vodacom via phone, email or Whatsapp system. Email auto reply says this channel is discontinued and to contact "Tobi" by phone or Whatsapp. On phone & Whatsapp, "Tobi" is programmed to tell you to email them. I even tried Twitter but those people could not even read simple English as they failed to answer to my actual question. Immediately Monday 14 Nov (3 days after SIM activation), I went in to their shop and there I was put in phone contact with an actual person. To fix the problem of the wrong product, they had to cancel the contract and collect the delivered product. <br /><br />I had to contact Vodacom again on 17 + 23 + 28 Nov because both the contract calcellation or the product collection has not been done yet. So the product was finally collected 30 Nov. <br /><br />But on 8 December I phoned Vodacom again to find out why I have not yet received the contract cancellation notice via email as I was told repeatedly. I only goy a voice recording that said "Our call center detects a high number of calls from your number. Your number is blocked to protect the system from fraudulant activity. You have to call ********** / ********** @ R2.00/minute for further help.” SERIOUSLY!!! blocked for fraudulant activity!? <br /><br />On 9 Dec I called the same Vodacom Billing Support numbers using family members phone. After speaking with someone I spoke with on 17 Nov, she put me through to the "cancellation dept". There I was put through to someone else again. After having to explain EVERYTHING AGAIN and a very long conversation, this guy confirmed his job was just to GET ME TO BUY ANOTHER CONTRACT! He was not able to cancel the contract but he said "did send an email to the "cancellation dept". <br /><br />At the shop they say they can not help me and I have to speak with those people on the phone. It just keeps going in circles and every time they lead you to *just another sales person* trying to sell you something.<br /><br />Today after 49 days Vodacom is still taking my money from my bank for this contract of an incorrect product which I do even not have any longer after they collected it from me.<br /><br />So what are we to do? How do we get Vodacom to actually deliver the product & service they sell us?<br />Can anyone help me please?              | Customer service              | The chatbot 'Tobi' is not able to provide adequate assistance and keeps redirecting the customer              | Improve the intelligence and capabilities of the chatbot to better understand and address customer queries              | Vodacom              | Vodacom has failed to deliver the correct product, provide proper customer support, and cancel the contract as promised              | Vodacom should rectify the delivery issue, improve customer support, and promptly cancel the contract as requested              |

MY ACCOUNT IS UP TO DATE I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING - except the monthly instalment of August 2022. Again I will not have money on the 22 August 2022, however I will make a payment via EFT does this mean that you will charge me R100,88 say that my account is in arrears?<br /><br />Which product am I paying for that I took with Vodacom for R100,88 or are you just  exploiting your customers for more money and justify it by saying that we didn't find money into your account on the debit order date.<br /><br />Please update my account with the correct balances - I don't owe you that money. Let's practice fair business - I made the payment, whether it's via EFT or debit order - payment was made.<br /><br />One more thing the BOT is very annoying, it calls all lines you have with VODACOM simultaneously and from my side that's harassment.              | Harassment              | The customer is complaining about receiving calls from a BOT, which they find annoying and consider harassment.              | Improve the chatbot system to avoid simultaneous calls to all customer lines and ensure a better customer experience.              | Vodacom              | The customer is complaining about being contacted by a BOT for an outstanding payment of R100.88, even though they made the payment via EFT and their account is up to date.              | Update the customer's account with the correct balances and ensure fair business practices by not charging additional fees for payments made via EFT.              |

| 2022-06-22 14:12:16              | vodacom              | Vodacom online deals are a SCAM | This company may as well rename itself to Vodascam, or Voda****s, or something of that nature, because their ONLINE deals are not a reflection of their actual contract prices. Their stupid robot changed the order I made for my wife's phone the next morning, adding a whopping R120 to the monthly bill for exactly the same thing. We thought this was erroneous, so we ignored the SMS. We did not confirm it, but they shipped the order anyway. Then they shipped it to the wrong address. They refused to accept a third party delivery (a.k.a. Me, because my wife cannot receive deliveries during the day), even though my work address was already verified under her account as a 3rd party. This meant that we never even got the phone after a month of waiting. They wasted everyone's time, including the courier (RAM) who went to the same old address where she no longer lives, about 5 times. Upon phoning the after-sales number we got from a Vodacom shop employee, they told me she could change the delivery address over the phone, so I relayed this to my wife and told her to phone them. Then they told her that they can't. That's the point when they also told her that the contract we bought does not allow Top-Ups and is actually R419/pm instead of R299/pm as per the "online exclusive" - and that they will change out-of-bundle rates for going over 500MB/month, which is NOT WHAT A TOP-UP CONTRACT IS. But they defended themselves, because if you go onto their website, their description of top-up and normal contracts are exactly the same. Top-up now also bills you after you use your data. This company is scamming people with misleading advertising and wording and a stupid ****ing robot that is utterly useless. It's swallowed my airtime before expiry multiple times before, but that's another issue entirely.              | Customer dissatisfaction              | The customer is complaining about the chatbot's role in changing their order and providing incorrect information              | Improve the chatbot's accuracy and ability to handle customer orders              | Vodacom online deals              | The customer is complaining about Vodacom's online deals being misleading and their order being changed without confirmation              | Resolve the issue with the customer's order and improve the transparency and accuracy of online deals              |

I dont want to speak to a machine. And i can not get through to a human. And Vodacom are stealing from me and they hope because i dont speak to a  human my problem goes away and i just leave it. Well sorry for them i will post a fantastic review like this for the rest of my life telling everyone how kak they are. <br />Hell man i am a programmer , i will right a multiplying bot that will post on the internet where ever it can how kak they are.  I will do this g i am not contacted and my data and airtime is not replaced within one hour. The board of directors are all monkeys and they should go back to the zoo. And we should get the baboons there to come run vodacom.

| 2022-01-11 09:28:29              | vodacom              | Vodacon diaries - consumer company that hates consumers | I believe consumer focused companies should never be measured by their ability to sell you new products but rather by how they stand by and support you when their services let you down. <br /><br />Vodacom is one of those consumer companies that is only to happy to take your money for the average service they deliver, but completely abandons you when you most need them when their own service, systems and people fail you. <br /><br />Vodacom is not a brand to be trusted or relied on, they will consistently fail you and charge you handsomely for the priviledge.<br /><br />While I was traveling out the country some random individual did a sim swap and a substantial upgrade on mobile phone account all via a call center. This resulted in a number of other attempts to access other relationships I hold by the parties who conducted the fraudulent upgrades. Sim swaps and fraudulent upgrades occur, that I understand does happen. However when you paint your company as a technology company that is nothing without humanity, you then cannot remove humanity from your organisation and leave your customers to fend entirely for themselves.<br /><br />There is a not a human employee of Vodacom that you can talk to find out why your account is blocked, how a fraudulent transaction was carried out and when your services will be reconnected as everything channels through Tobi the chatbot who is able to sell you more airtime or upgrade a phone but fraud ... no can do.<br /><br />All staff in the stores are franchise staff, who face the same challenges as the consumer, so again no easy fix and they are largely helpless unless you need airtime or an upgrade. <br /><br />Speaking of upgrades, short of providing a DNA swap I get asked for all kinds of supporting documents when upgrading mobile phones in pursuit of RICA, FICA and other regulatory requirements. So my only conclusion is that there is some form of syndicate operating within Vodacom to enable this activity without the same level of due diligence taking place. <br /><br />My question to Vodacom is why focus so much getting customers into you ecosystem if you have no plans to support them once they are in it. I have been a customer for 20 years (not loyal, just easier not to change to another provider that is as bad as yourselves) and have grown to dislike the company intensely - not because I feel I am overcharged (although I am) or because I constantly drop calls (which I do) but because when I need assistance to resolve issues there is no one to assist adequately or timeously. <br /><br />Be better              | Customer service              | The customer is complaining about the lack of human support and assistance from Vodacom when facing issues with fraudulent activity on their account.              | Improve the chatbot's capabilities to handle fraud-related issues and provide a more efficient and satisfactory customer support system.              | Vodacom              | The customer is dissatisfied with Vodacom's lack of support and assistance when facing fraudulent activity on their account.              | Vodacom should prioritize customer support and provide adequate assistance to customers facing issues, especially related to fraud.              |

On Thursday I had made a follow up with RAM's Xavier who ensured me that my parcel would be out on delivery the next day, Friday 10/12/2021. I have not received the delivery as promised. When I followed up around lunch time I was told by RAM that my parcel is still with them, all the drivers were out for the day already. I was not given a proper reason t=why my parcel was left behind.

Vodacom uses any balance to automatically purchase airtime. Today I recharged with R110. R61 went to airtime advance. R23.96 to a call. I had a balance of 25.04. I wanted to buy a WhatsApp ticket for R3 as I was leaving the house where I have fiber.

| 2021-03-11 12:08:12              | vodacom              | Vodacom Customer Care | After listening to the automated menu on your customer care line far too many times and trying to wait it out for the consultant on nearly every menu option mostly unrelated to the issue I wanted to solve, I FINALLY managed to get through to a consultant who was very helpful. I can't even remember during which part of the menu I was finally offered the option to hold for a consultant because your customer care line keeps trying to divert to your "self-help" bot "Tobi".<br /><br />Suggestions from a customer if you do not want to lose customers in future:<br /><br />1. If you want people to use the bot, that's all good and well, but make sure it at least works before you place it in your call menu. <br /><br />2. After going through nearly your entire call menu to get to a consultant, I can at least let you know, your "Tobi" bot only "works" on SMS, not WhatsApp. Even if you select the WhatsApp option. I can also tell you, typing "menu" as instructed after the bot texts, does not work. Typing ANY word relating to possible Vodacom issues such as "account", "billing", "cancellations" (I can go on), does not work. An annoying message just pops up saying the bot cannot help me with this, please dial 082 135. The sad reality is that customer care number sent me to the bot more times than I can count. <br /><br />3. Another area that needs fixing is getting into my account online. Once I have a set fee for a year or more, I don't go into my account online. Therefore I can never seem to remember the password I use the random time a couple years ago that I wanted to check when my contract is due for an upgrade. If I click "forgot password", it sends me an OTP. Which is all good and well, that works. However, when they send a new password for you to use, even after 1 min, 1 hour, 1 day. It will never work. So I cannot get into MY Vodacom account, FORCING me to phone customer care, which is pretty much FORCING me to use the broken bot.<br /><br />4. After finally reaching a very helpful consultant which is all I was looking for in the first place and they asked me to rate their service, you give an option to give them a 10 for very satisfactory. However, every time I typed 10, it said I gave the consultant a 1, and asked if I meant to give them a 1. Why ask to rate a 10 if a person can't give a 10 rating? Why not just make 9 the highest rating?<br /><br />I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I had to spend at least 2 hours of my time trying to get into my account online and phoning customer care to speak to a consultant to finally fix such a small issue. Fortunately for you, I'm quite patient, but I'm definitely not happy with having to try so many different avenues which is what took up my time. I can tell you now, there are many customers out there that would never have put up with this. The punchline, I just wanted to find out why my account was so high last month because for some reason I didn't receive an invoice for last month when I moved from a normal cell phone contract to only a data contract.  <br /><br />On a positive note, while I was trying to access a consultant, I eventually had an idea to contact you on FB messenger. I received a reply within 5 minutes. Unfortunately, it came through just after a consultant answered the phone and helped me. I wish I had thought of taking that route first as I could have had 2 hours of my life to do something more useful and I wouldn't have written this poor review.<br /><br />By the way, I would have given you a rating of 1 but seeing as your actual consultants are polite and willing to help I raised it to 2.              | Customer care chatbot              | The customer complained about the chatbot diverting their call and not being helpful.              | Improve the functionality of the chatbot and ensure it is compatible with all communication channels.              | Vodacom Customer Care              | The customer had difficulty reaching a consultant and faced issues with the chatbot and online account access.              | Fix the issues with the call menu, chatbot, and online account access to provide better customer service.              |

| 2021-02-05 15:46:18              | vodacom              | The Most Feckless Company in South Africa | It was a difficult decision to rate Vodacom with one star since even no stars would have indicated a massive over-achievement by this money grabbing, third rate company.<br /><br />Having been a victim of fraud, I needed to contact a human to discuss the details of the crime in an effort to get them to acknowledge and cancel a debit order, but at the same time to assist them in themselves not continuing to fall victim to this fraudster and incur more losses.<br /><br />Contact "Customer Service" it says on the website. If I didn't know better, I died and am now spending and eternity in purgatory, because whether its 082 135, their so called "online chat" or even their more so called "intelligent chat bot", all roads lead to a dead end and you never get to speak to anyone about anything. Wait too long in the chat and it just drops you, the IVR never happens to have an option to speak to a human and the intelligent chat bot was clearly designed by someone with a room temperature IQ. Oh and don't try email the customer services mailbox either; For me, as a non-Vodacom customer, it asks you to tell it various pieces of information about a fraudulent account that was set up in your name, which you obviously won't have access to, and then when you don't provide that information, it simply ignores your email. Truly another award winning piece of development done there by Vodacom, well done.<br /><br />This company does not care about anyone in the slightest. If you are at any point considering using them to provide you a "service", literally look anywhere else because it will probably be better.

I had it on my last rant, and I'm sure I'll get it here. Some very important people at Vodacom made an executive decision that my problem had been resolved, and that despite the promises made, I didn't need to be contacted. Hello Peter I'm sure, would not tolerate 4 letter words !<br /><br />There are more pillars and posts to be shoved around at Vodacom, than the Parthenon. fewer tour guides . <br />The general view is, that moving this person on to someone else, the problem will go away.
