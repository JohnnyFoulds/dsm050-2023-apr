What a useless bunch. Long story short my dual sim phone was stolen, went to cellc to do a swimswap 15 minutes later sorted. Went to Vodacom it's been 3 days and still no joy. I have been in store (apparently they can't verify me - even though on my app and online profile the number is linked to my account) I have tried phoning 082 135 (don't waist your time it is a bot and no intelligence behind it - asks me for my new SIM nr I enter it sorry we don't recognise the number) Tried the chat option agent says they can't perform the task. And nowhere is there an option to speak to an agent", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
