I tried numerous times before leaving the country to make sure that they are aware that I will be out of the country, and I will need to make use of Data roaming when I am out of the country. With every attempt, I failed. There is never a number that I can make use of to contact Telkom, I am told to make use of the Whatsapp Chatbot, or they will send me an SMS, which they do. But the stupid thing just does not work. I am stuck in another country right now, and I am not able to access my line, which is ridiculous. I tried their Chatbot, but it does not work. I have run out of ideas as to how to contact Telkom. Your service is the worst service that I have ever experienced", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
