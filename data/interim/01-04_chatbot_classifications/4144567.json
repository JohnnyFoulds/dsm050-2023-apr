I was the advised that my phone have been blacklisted. Frustrated I stayed calm, followed the instructions, completed the unblacklist form and sent it via email. The phone was blacklisted on Friday 14 Oct 2022, it is now a week later and still nothing, no reply on the numerous emails and the tobi bot is a absolute joke. Needless to say I am highly irritated as I had to leave my phone off for 48 hours, then another 48 hours and still ****all happened. I have been a loyal Vodacom customer for many many years. I use my phone for business purposes and can\u2019t have it off for an entire week. Please assist ASAP", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
