Still surprises me that a simswap can be done online via a Robot (Tobi), and without true verification of the actual customer, according to them by just answering 3 (Yes / No) general knowledge or guessing game questions called security questions. 1: \"Do you use an Alcatel cellphone\"\n2: Waa your last recharge for R100.00\" are some of their security questions. Vodacom does not care about their customers at all. I have 1st hand experience, they do not want to take accountability if their failure.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
