If there is, please let me know.\n\nI chatted with the chatbot where a consultant advised to call their centre (funny yes, cuz I request a call back...) I tried calling, but invalid... WOW! \n\nI have asked to be called several times by this so called 'top rated' cell provider, however it does not seem as if they want any business. As by the looks of it, it seems as if no one can reach them. Why do you even have a contact number or shall I rather say several that also ring to invalid? Maybe if I leave a review, they will actually assist me.  Coming from a call centre, this is actually such an unorganized organization.", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
