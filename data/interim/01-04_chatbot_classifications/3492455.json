Vodacom called back from the complaints department telling me that they have sorted everything out and they have stock of all the items as per the upgrade. But surprise surprise when I called this morning to find out about the delivery have start telling me again they have no stock. Really this is becoming a joke it has been 2 weeks of lies and people bot having a clue what they doing . It seems like the goal for the employees at vodacom is only to get the upgrade or the new contract even if they do not have the products they selling and then it becomes your problem to chase them everyday to get what you ordered. My advice to anybody wanting to upgrade with vodacom via the call centre . Is DO NOT DO IT. Rather go to the other service providers .", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
