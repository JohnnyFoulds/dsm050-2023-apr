I am trying to assist an old gentleman with his vodamail password but even after reseeting it it does not work and vodacom support has been no help at all, as I can not ecen speak to someone, tried to phone upgeades and funny enough they answer and if I ask them to put me through to support they say I must just press option 2, as I told them option 2 is for sim swap, they can not help me. I will also not be upgrading my phone at Vodacom this August and also from August not buy any data from vodacom anymore, if you can't help someone with a simple issue like a email password that is not working why should I support you? Anyway vodacom services has went down the drain since all your pricws droppes since the court case you have. Would rather spend more money somewhere else for a better service.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
