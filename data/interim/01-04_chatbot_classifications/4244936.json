They are literally the most useless mobile company that I ever had to deal with and I am glad that I decided to move to another provider. Useless employees can't even assist you in one of their branches neither over the phone. I just wonder what they pay these people to do, they might as well let all of them go because the one is more useless than the other.\nHere is what happened, I cancelled my contract earlier, I paid the settlement amount that they gave me, yet two years later on a credit report it shows I owe Vodacom money???? Yet again, two years ago after I sent the proof of payment the useless Vodacom staff could not do a simple task of updating this and sending me the settlement letter confirming that all is in order. Why are you even open Vodacom, it is very obvious that you want customer's money but do not want to assist the customers!!! Not to even talk about the rubbish chat bot that you trying to use. I spent half an hour trying to get someone to assist me, but they are probably sleeping and not yet again not doing their jobs!!! and by the way, IF you give an email on your useless chat bot to use, MAKE SURE IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
