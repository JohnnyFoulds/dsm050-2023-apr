I could use my phone only as that . Of course I tried to contact Vodacom by sending them messages-  and by phoning in . Their robot TOBi is incredibly infuriating ,asking all the most stupid questions and only making one more frustrated and furious. The internet is back now for me in a very sketchy fashion- I wanted Some sort of BOOSTER from Vodacom in my home but who do you ask at a business which you cannot contact in any meaningful way? I spend nearlyR1000 a month on my contract but nobody there cares a hoot!IWhat a lack of customer empathy , interaction and care!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
