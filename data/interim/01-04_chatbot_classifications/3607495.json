I closed a contract with them in September 2020 and to my shock they were still debiting my account. I followed up to be refunded for a good 3 months and each time I am told that my query is in progress and I will be refunded in 14 days. I am still waiting even today. To make matters worse, it seems like robots handle their queries because each time I get a different report not related to a response they last gave me. They also assign random date as to when the query was logged which is fraudulent but covers them in this scam of theirs. Their Twitter page has blatantly ignored my complaints for months also, also on their page they insist it is the right channel to complain. \nI am really disgusted by the service.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
