Instead, I keep getting SMSes saying it's running out in a week's time. It never provisioned. Called their customer care and went from pillar to post with Toby's questions and options.\n\nIf Vodacom still at all cares for any of their customers, can I please get some assistance? This is unacceptable and it's not the first time. Vodacom is infamous for *****ing people's money. I thought I'd give them another chance to change my mind, what a terrible mistake. \n\nCorrect this now please.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
