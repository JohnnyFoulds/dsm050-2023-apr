On the bot system I was able to make the changes to the new date of witch the debit order should go off.\n\nNow I am being told that the system never updated with the correct date, so I am in arrears and for that the can't change the date as I need to pay first.\n\nSo then why the hell did I go though all that effort to try and change the date to avoid all this nonsense just for them to not care. I just got off the phone with Vodacom collection telling me so be it I need to pay as the debit order failed, regardless if If I tried to change the date to ensure that it won't.\n\nI must be honest, Vodacom has the worst support I've ever seen and I work in a service delivery environment.\n\nUnbelievable how careless and arrogant they can be, the less work they have to do to resolve the case the longer they can sit around and do nothing.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
