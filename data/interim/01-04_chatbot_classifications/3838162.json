If I go online I can upgrade to other contracts with other handsets to the value or R877 per month , more than the contract that I actually want with the I phone 13 which is approx R640 per month. They are simply bot prepared to help me. It's really sad when you have been such a loyal customer who spends alot of money with them every month. I think it's time to start canceling my contracts!!!", "suggestion": "Vodacom should review their credit rating policy and provide better assistance to loyal customers."}, "meta": {"id": 3838162, "created_at": "2022-03-02 21:18:53", "review_rating": 1, "review_title": "Extremely poor service", "review_content": "I have 5 contracts with vodacom and have been a loyal customer for many years.
