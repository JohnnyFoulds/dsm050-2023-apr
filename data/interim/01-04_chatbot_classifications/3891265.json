Buy bundles but never receive all paid for.\n2. Complete goals to get vodabucks but mostly don't get it.\n3. Try complaining and you get shoved in the hands of a robot, Tobi.\n4. Acc got hacked once and airtime used plus advance and they said it's me.\n5. Worse of all is the rate in which data prices keep climbing, yet you never get the value advertised and never close enough to getting compensation for your money and what's owed. \n.I'm done with Vodacom now and switching networks coz I can't be giving my money to the company who has more anyway. You'll stay greedy.\nI highly do not recommend vodacom and will not never do so.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
