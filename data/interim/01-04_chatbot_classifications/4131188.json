Which on its own really sucks.\nWhen i go to Vodacom outlet to get new simcard, I'm asked for my ID, proof of address and last 5 numbers i called. How is it that someone managed to do sim swap without having to submit these documents and me as the registered/ FICA person i should struggle. Once i succeed in getting my number back, bye bye vodacom.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
