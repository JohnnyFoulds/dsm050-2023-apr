I have been sending messenger on Vodacom's social media fb page, they take hours to come back and ask you 1 question. at the moment my internet has stopped working since last night, i reported this early this morning, and it's now after 14h00, i am still unable to work and no support whatsoever from Vodacom. i cannot work, but i will be expected to make payments come next month on this same account that is preventing me from making money.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
