Vodacom Fibre has the worst service. If you're thinking about signing up, DONT!!! They are quick to sell you their product but when it comes to support, they don't show up. I signed up for unlimited wifi plan and for over a year the router worked with no issues. About a week ago, the router stopped working and upon logging a query with support, never heard anything back from them. Called so many times & spoke to different tech agents repeating the same robotic procedure they've been taught to do over the phone. Lost the whole week as I work from home and to date they have not sent an urgent out. Upon calling them to cancel my month to month subscription they told me they need a month's notice. So now I must pay them for wifi that doesn't work and have made zero effort to come and sort out the problem. Being held hostage by Vodacom, I do not recommend this company for fibre at all.", "suggestion": "Vodacom Fibre should improve their customer support by responding to queries promptly and providing timely assistance to customers facing issues with their service.
