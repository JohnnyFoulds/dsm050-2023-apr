Spoke to a lady called Boitumelo Ximba at the door and after I told her that I need my contact cancelled as it has already exceeded 24 months. She carried on like a robot and kept on telling me that it has automatically reactivated and when I told them I was never advised of that and that it was never stipulated on my contract her colleague also went on robotically and advised the same. When I asked them for their customer care or escalations emails address she told me twice even after verifying with someone in the store that such a huge organisation doesn\u2019t have one. Boitumelo and her colleague that assisted me they need to be please taken for proper training so they could have product knowledge and customer service as they have really lowered the Telkom standards by misinforming clients.
