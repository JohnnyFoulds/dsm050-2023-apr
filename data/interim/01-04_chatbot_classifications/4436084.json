I have been trying to get a refund since May 4th, but have had no success. I have spoken to multiple representatives, sent proof of payment multiple times, and even escalated the issue to a manager. However, I have not received any updates or resolution. This has caused me financial distress as I am running low on food, fuel, and electricity. I am desperate for someone to take ownership of my issue and resolve it promptly.", "suggestion": "Please expedite the refund process and provide regular updates to the customer.

The sequence of events between then and now is as follows. \n1. Was told to send proof of payment - no response \n\n2. was told to send proof of payment again, - no response\n\n3. I was told to email collections. No response \n\n4. phoned call centre, and was asked to email proof of payment, I also added in my banking statement so they could see what i was referring to for extra clarity. \n\n5. getting desperate now , running low on food money , I call again, and eventually on the May the 15th somebody with a brain cell , raised a refund ticket for me, I was told someone would be in contact with me within 2 days  - no one phoned. \n\n6. I followed up the next day , I was told that the refund would be escalated but this process takes 72 hours. \n\n7. Friday 19th of May I eventually demanded to speak to a manager , who also was not very helpful, His name is Tshepho , he said the process takes 10 business days, ( not true I looked on their company site and its 7 working days ) he just said he had marked my refund as urgent in a mailbox. yes in a mailbox with 5000 other emails. I have almost no money at this point. I need electricity as I work from home, I need food to feed my kids, I need fuel to get them to school. No one cares. they dont care. \n\n8. Monday 22nd May - I phone early in the morning and asked to speak to Tshepho the manager from Friday. I was told he will phone me in ten minutes that was at 8:39am. I phoned the call center back at 11am , who then said they are transferring me to him  but instead I was on hold for 39min  until eventually I dropped the call. I eventually got hold of Tshepho , and all he could say was he can see its in the approval process. Not once has anyone offered to take ownership and keep me updated. \nI burst into tears begging that he help me , I need to feed my kids. \nIts almos time for the next debit order run. He doesnt care, he cant go the extra mile, he said he has not contacts in finance to call and ask for assistance. We had bread for supper last night. \n\n10. Its Tuesday the 23rd of May , I call again at 10:30am this morning, I ask to speak to Tshepho , I am told he is on lunch, but I must not worry he will phone me back as soon as he gets in. You guessed it , its almost 4pm and no one has called me. I phone back at 3pm this afternoon , I am told that they can see that the refund has been approved, but that does not mean that the money is on its way to my account. Keep in mind today is the 7th working day since I raised the refund ticket. The lady tells me that it takes 7 days after the refund has been approved. \n\nI feel defeated. I have no food in my house, both my kids went to school hungry today , I have almost no fuel left in my car , I have 8 units of electricity to last me until I get paid. \n\nHow is it that you F&*&(&(*&*& C(*&()*&)*(&)(*7 can affect my life like this ? Emotionless. YOU STOLE MY FOOD MONEY TO FEED MY KIDS THIS WEEK. NO BODY CARES THAT YOU HAVE KIDS TO FEED AND TO BE ABLE TO WORK. \n\nI AM AT MY WITS END, PLEASE CAN SOMEONE DO SOMETHING. THIS IS REDICULOUS TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS MINE. \n\nYOU DID THIS NOT ME . YOU HAVE CRIPPLED ME THIS MONTH YOU STUPID TWITS. \n\nCAN SOMEONE IN CELL C WAKE UP AND FIX THIS . YOU CANNOT GET THROUGH TO ANYONE THAT IS ABLE TO ACTUALLY HELP YOU. \n\nITS WORSE THAN GOING THROUGH A DRIVE THROUGH AND ASKING FOR THE LETTUCE TO BE REMOVED, BUT INSTEAD THEY REMOVE ALL THE GARNISH, YOU ARE WORSE !!! \n\nHOW ON EARTH MUST I FEED MY KIDS THIS WEEK.", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
