I have contacted their call center multiple times, spent a lot of money on airtime, and sent numerous emails, but have not received any helpful assistance. The responses I receive seem automated and do not address my issue. I have also requested a call back, but have not received any response. I am extremely disappointed with the service provided by Rain.", "suggestion": "Rain should improve their customer service by training their call center staff to be knowledgeable about common issues like PUK numbers. They should also ensure that their email responses are personalized and address the customer's specific concerns. Additionally, they should have a system in place to escalate issues to team leaders or managers when necessary."}, "meta": {"id": 3457539, "created_at": "2021-04-13 12:15:23", "review_rating": 1, "review_title": "Rain Over Promise but Never Deliver.", "review_content": "I registered with them received my SIM on the 24 March 2021 today is 13 April 2021 Ithe sim is blocked have been asking for PUK number \nI have called Rain call center Day and night have wasted more than R500 on airtime no one can help me; all consultant I spoke to don't know that thier SIM has a PUK number.
