Let\u2019s let the robbers access all my personal information, apps, banking, and you get back to me) \u2026 *** \u2026. So now at Cell C I get the same story and I have no option but to wait \u2026. I then try to do a sim stop and swop as I need some type of way for people to get hold of me \u2026. I am told that Cell C has a new policy whereby you need to submit ans remember your entire life to questions \u2026. \u201cHow long have you been a Cell C customer ( *** \u2026 a long time) \u2026 When was the last time you recharged? The exact date, amount and type of recharge \u2026. And what are the 5 most common numbers (exact numbers) that you frequently dial \u2026 Having not known all of these exacts, full of negative emotion, stress, anxiety, and dealing with what I\u2019ve just gone through, no I must go home and phone customer care they will help you \u2026. I go home, and same **** with customer care, only I\u2019m dealing with a robot whose not willing to treat me like a human being with some sort of logic, and understanding for what I was dealing with \u2026. I was then sent back to Cell C store \u2026. Long story short \u2026. Instead of spending the day sorting things out with my insurance and police I had spent from 11am to 17:30pm with Cell C \u2026. I have been a customer for 9 years \u2026 sometimes on contract and for a short time off \u2026. Never have I had a days trouble \u2026. Well after this \u2026 as your customer care script says: \u201cSorry for your loss\u201d \u2026", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
