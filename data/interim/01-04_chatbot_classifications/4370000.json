I defy anyone getting anything sorted via their call centre. All I wanted to do do was find out how much data I get on a monthly basis. I tried numerous time using the call desk. After atempting this numerous times I was unable to try this eventually tried the Chat bot and asked how I speak to a human to assist and was told \"I cannot help you with this\". In desperation phones the ***** line to see if I could get a niumber and got exactly the same options as the 135 Number - sorry for anyone who wishes to report ***** - it appears that MTN does not allow you to do this. \nABSOLUTELY SHOCKING!!!!! CALL YOURSELVES A SERVICE PROVIDER? YOU HAVE NO CONCEPT OF SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "business_slug": "mtn"}}
