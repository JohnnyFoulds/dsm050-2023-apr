Nobody called back to follow up as per the message after the completion of the order. The online chatbot bombed out halfway through the conversation. I eventually spoke to Mellisa Pillay who advised me that the phone that I'm looking to purchase is out of stock (on backorder for 6 weeks). Excuses ranging from  \"the website needs to be updated\" , to \"all our customers know our terms and conditions regarding phones that are out of stock\" were dished out. Yet for the past 2 weeks, these deals have been advertised on the website. Amazingly enough, there are deals clearly grayed out stating clearly that certain contracts are out of stock. \nNot being able to transfer me to a senior person due to working remotely was another excuse to cut the call.\nWhat complete rubbish and pathetic service Vodacom.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
