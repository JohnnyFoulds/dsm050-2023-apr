When you want to enter through their vodacom site and can't remember your password as you haven't use it for YEARS, they send you a password reset or something to your email adress BUT YOUR EMAIL DOESN'T WORK, so how on earth do you access it? When you phone their customer number, ANY OPTION YOU CHOOSE SEND YOU TO THEIR USELESS ROBOT and when you want to talk to an agent, you must register a certain voice notification **** and say a specific sentence.  Well I've said that sentence FOUR times and every time I say it, it was wrong? I said it slow, I said it normal and even word for word, but nothing works. SO HOW DO YOU GET TO TALK TO AN AGENT AND NOT THEIR USELESS ROBOT WHICH DOESN'T HAVE THE OPTION WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING FOR?", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
