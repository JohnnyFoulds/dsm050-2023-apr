I went back to the VodaPay App and there was no R100 there as well.\n\nI then contacted VodaPay support using the Bot and lost the connection. I was contacted by an agent who informed me that they have already reached their 200 limit for the day. After telling the agent that I literally just recieved the pop up notification and immediately went and downloaded the VodaPay App. \n\nThe question remains that it does not necessarily mean that in those few minutes they received more than 200nnew downloads and I personally think that it is false advertising just to gain more users.\n\nVery misleading and very disappointing.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
