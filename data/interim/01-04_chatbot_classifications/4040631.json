You email and they also refer you to talk to tobi on app. They ask to authenticate over email and take days to answer with a pathetic robot response that has no solution!!\n\nVery pathetic service and for the 1st time till using this network I will not renew this contract. This time I cancel and change to a network that has people helping customers.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
