Unhelpful and utter disregard for people at the the Gateway Store. I had to get an affidavit and send it to the call centre well that call centre does not their phones it\u2019s answered  by robotic answering service with a robotic self help instructor\u2026 which is no absolutely no help. I tried calling the entire day\u2026", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
