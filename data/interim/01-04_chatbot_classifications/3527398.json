Then I tried the chat bot TOBi but it wouldn't allow you to type. Then I got through to a consultant but I already placed an upgrade order for the Samsung Galaxy S21 Grey only to get an SMS to say there is no stock of the device, the consultant said they only have the violet colour. I was going to give my dad my S10e for his birthday but now I have to wait after his birthday because the new stock is allegedly available only on his birthday, MTN has better deals and they have stock of the grey S21. Thanks Vodacom!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
