Our wifi lost internet connectivity and upon contacting Vodacom, it transpired that the issue was with the Vodacom router. Vodacom had advised that they have a 24 hour to 36 hour turnaround time to send a technician to my home to give us a new router. It\u2019s 5 days and NO ONE from Vodacom has contacted us. When I followed up 3 days later, I was told that they tried to get hold of us and they were unsuccessful. It turns out the number they apparently used to \u201ccontact us\u201d is wrong yet the very same company does security checks using our correct cellphone number. Definitely appears to me that we are being told lies that we were contacted by their technicians when no one contacted us. They have promised to escalate the matter and still the matter remains unresolved and no one has contacted us. They have costed me so much of money as I work from home so I have had to buy lots of data and use my phone as a hotspot and since the phone is not a strong internet connection point, I have lost connectivity during important meetings which has made me lose credibility. It\u2019s totally appalling that they treat customers like this. The worst part is that we can\u2019t even buy our own router and plug it in because their technicians need to come out and programme everything. If you want a service provider that will give you ZERO service when you have problems with your wifi connectivity and will leave you stranded for days without internet connectivity , then Vodacom fibre is for you. Their call centre agents have also been trained to respond like robots and \u201capologise for the inconvenience caused\u201d and the minute the call ends, your query  is all forgotten and nothing gets done while you continue to suffer as a customer", "suggestion": "Vodacom should improve their customer service by ensuring timely response and resolution of issues.
