Her sim card was hacked, as advised by the service provider. Whilst it was seemingly easy for someone to hack a Cell C number, it is impossible for to prove to Cell C that it was her number. The 'robots' at the call centre ask some a number of questions, including re activity on the number/sim card! ow the hell is one able to do that when it has been hacked and not in your control??!! Of course she cannot answer to their satisfaction, so cannot help. Trying to port the number to another provider is impossible as Cell C send a SMS to confirm, which she of course cannot receive! Amazing how easy it is for a scammer to get control of a Cell C number but the true owner cannot. Absolutely pathetic!", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
