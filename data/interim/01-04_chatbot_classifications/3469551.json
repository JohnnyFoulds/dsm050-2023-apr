I cant get through to a agent because when i try chat on WhatsApp, it keeps telling me that i am apparently not a customer. When i try call the call support number from my other sim card, there is not option to speak to a agent. I cant go through the Vodacom app either because apparently I am not a customer either!!! What is the point of having all these ways to communicate if i cant get help!!! Please call ME on ********** in regards to **********!!!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
