I got an SMS to say my data connection has stopped and to contact Telkom. When I dialled 081180, I was sent to Whatsapp chat bot which gave list of options to press, none of which suited my issue. I dial 10210 with the same result being referred to Whatsapp Chat bot. Dialled 10213 which also has no option to query why my data has stopped. \nThis is extremely frustrating, why can I not get to talk to a Customer Service agent about data related issues?", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
