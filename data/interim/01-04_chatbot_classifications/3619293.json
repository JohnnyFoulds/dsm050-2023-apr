This was not the case, in actual fact I am now going to pay R122.97 more every month. I think it is absolutely scandalous that these people prey on the elderly. I have been a customer with Vodacom for 24 years and I find it quite outrageous to be treated with such disdain.\n\nI went to the Vodacom Shop and was told that they could not help, but would send an email to the support team, which was duly done and told me to call various numbers, only to find that my calls were not answered, cut off or told to speak to a Bot named Tobi. I am old school I want person to person contact.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
