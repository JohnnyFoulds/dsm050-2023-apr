I purchased 2 GB data for R149 at 09:45 on 02/05/2022 only to have my router fail to connect to the Vodacom network. After consulting with the vodacom shop that issued the sim card, I was informed that the number no longer belonged to me because it was in disuse for 3 months and that I would be unable to receive a refund for the data loaded on the number via internet banking. I was never warned that the number would be removed from my name. This is something even Telkom managed to do in the past. Not alerting clients that their number will be removed from service and reassigning these numbers to a new person presents a major security risk. I am tired of \"speaking\" to \"Toby\", your useless chatbot and I cannot get hold of a human. Should this be the level of service I can expect of Vodacom, I would rather go back to Cell-C and deal with their load-shedding outages.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
