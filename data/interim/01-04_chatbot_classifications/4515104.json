What a useless piece of technology.  I would like to rather speak to a human and not some computer.  I had a problem with my phone and after going through the whole answer system, instead of getting an agent to help me, I am routed to Tobi.  Again we go through a whole lot of questions.  Then Tobi tell me that he is unable to help me and asks if I would like to speak to an agent.  I confirm with a \"yes\" and Tobi responds with \"you have chosen the self help option\".  Totally not what I have chosen and we start again.  Because choosing to speak to an Agent previously haven't helped, I now chose not to speak to an Agent.  Thinking that maybe Tobi is a bit confused.  So I say \"no\".  To which Tobi replies \"I am unable to help you at this stage.  Goodbye\".  Frustrating to no measure.  Vodacom, if you are going to go the automated route, make sure it actually works. GRRRR!!!!!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
