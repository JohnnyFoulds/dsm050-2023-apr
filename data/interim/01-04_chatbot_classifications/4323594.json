When I went to my next Vodacom branch at De Ville Centre in Durbanville Central on February 22 at 11.15 the shop assistant was rude and quarrelsome. After some arguing I got him to delete the welcome tone. For my claim to be refunded I was given the Vodacom Customer Care telephone number. On that number I did not find any option for complaints and was talking to their chat bot only.  I still do not know how to get to them for my claim.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
