That is how pathetic Telkom's Service is.\nOn the day before National lockdown last year, I contacted Telkom to have my internet contract upgraded as I had to work from home. I spent hours on the phone that day only to find out the next day that my contract was cancelled as I did not qualify for the upgrade. Without informing me I had to make numerous phone calls for weeks and months without any success. Up until now I have bot used the Tekom Services and only to be informed that I was handed over for outstanding payments. How could I pay for no services provided. \nBy the way the work had to make arrangements for me to ensure that I had wifi/ internet to work from home which I am still using.\nHope someone can investigate\n\nKind Regards\nSandra\n", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
