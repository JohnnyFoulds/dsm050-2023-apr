Been on Vodacom for 20 years and I wanted to cancel with a line of many I was not using. Despite following all the advised ways to cancel and don't use tobi the robot as he never understands and keeps taking you back to the main menu. % months later I was still being charged, I took a chance and dropped into Bellairs Chats Vodacom and Hilton went out the way to sort it pout and even brought proof of cancellation. I wonder how long I will have to wait for the refund. I was on the verge of porting all my lines to a competitor.
