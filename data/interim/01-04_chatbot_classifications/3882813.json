Both the site and app claim to offer this option, but both just report \"a technical problem\".  The site and app claim to offer online chat.  On the site this just leads to a page with a submit button that doesn't work (the dev console reports that the site won't accept the call from its own button). On the app it just leads to the eternally pointless chatbot. I'll never understand why businesses don't wait until someone creates a chatbot that is actually useful before starting to use them.  Unfortunately the only other way Vodacom offers for contacting them is by phone.  That's all very well when in South Africa, but not every customer is in SA all the time.  So they've now blocked any customer who needs support outside of SA from getting any.  Unless they can afford the cost of an international call, of course.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a company that pretends to offer features and sees to it that contacting them ranges from difficult to impossible, look no further.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
