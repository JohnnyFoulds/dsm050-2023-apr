Nothing happened.\nI tried to speak to a human today but Tobi tried to help me and he doesn't understand anything because it's a bot.\nThen a consultant called me and she couldn't understand the difference between Mastercard and Masterpass and told me to speak to my bank because she can't see anything on the system. \nKindly refund me or give me my airtime.\nAlso kindly train your support people better.\nAlso, Tobi is dumb.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
