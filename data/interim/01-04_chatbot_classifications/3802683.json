After cancelling my contract I was charged more money that I would have had to pay if I stayed with that contract. I received my FINAL statement form Telkom and it has a negative amount. Not wanting to find myself interpreting it as \u201cmoney owed to me\u201d by Telkom,I tried to contact Telkom in more than TWO ways.\nWay 1, via the WhatsApp chat bot,very useless.\nWay 2, 102.. and 180 numbers where there\u2019s no option of speaking to the consultant.\nWay 3, Telkom app chat to an agent option,all I got after 3 attempts was a \u201cHi,you are chatting to *X* ,how May I assist l?\u201d After responding with my matter there would be no answer. (Mind you it happened more than two times)\nWay 4 on the telkom website, where you\u2019ll get over 60 steps to follow and never get what you are looking for.\n\nWhat a waste of time. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Telkom to my worst enemy.", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
