My first issues is with emergency top-up. How can a 43seconds call finish R10 airtime? I have been trying to get answers but customer services is failing me. If you call customer service line and respond that you know your cellphone number, they cut the call and shove you to a WhatsApp bot which is very limited.\n\nTo be able to speak to a consultant you have to lie and claim to not know your number. All the customer consultants I have spoken to, when I ask about how such few minutes finish R10 or even R20, they just put me on hold and say they are checking, next thing the line has a voice saying I have reached the voicemail service whilst still holding.\n\nAs of this moment, before I recharged with R20, the ETU Airtime balance was R8.30, but wasn't allowing me to make a call. How's that possible?", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
