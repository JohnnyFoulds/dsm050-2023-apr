Their so called robot Tobi sent a link for the payment of which the payment was done but i received an error thereafter. The funds were deducted from my account. I called vodacom and the lady who assisted me took my details and advised she will make contact in 24/48 hours with a response. a lady called on an 082 cell number and advised that she will sms the email address for me to send the bank statement. that never happened and i eventually had to call again to get the email address. I sent the bank statement on tuesday to the *********** email address and until then nothing. This afternoon I call again and spoke to Njabulo Mchunu (27/01/21 18:35) who advised me that \"HE WILL SEND AN EMAIL BUT NO SURE IF SOMEONE WILL ACTUALLY CONTACT ME\" The nerve and the arrogance of vodacom employees to tell you straight in your face that they will ask somebody to do their job but not sure that they will do it is somehow appalling. I need my account to be sorted out ASAP and payment to be back date first thing tomorrow morning and for somebody to call me and explain why it will take so many days to resolve one issue.
