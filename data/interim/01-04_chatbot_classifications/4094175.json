The only place Vodacom even MENTIONS it is in one line on their Ts & Cs: \"You may activate and deactivate the Recurring Bundles at any time.\" The word \"deactivate\" is then never mentioned again. I've tried everything - *135# for USSD self-help, SMS chatbot, WhatsApp chatbot, and even PHONING 135 to get assistance, where just another useless robot gives me NO WAY to get hold of a human and no relevant options to help me. An old post on your Twitter says dial *135*6#, but that is not relevant to cancelling recurring data bundles. So, I have one question: \"HOW DO I CANCEL A RECURRING 30-DAY DATA BUNDLE?\"", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
