But to put a cherry on top of their rotten service, they say I cannot lodge a complaint. My debit order date is the 5th of every month. On the 5th of April Telkom did not debit my account. There was sufficient funds in the account. Therefore, it was not a bounce. And if it was a bounce, the bank would have notified me of the bounce and would have charged me. I called the contact centre and I was informed that Telkom did not collect the money due to a system error. During that time, I did not receive any notification from Telkom or any type of communication indicating that the account was in arrears.\n\nI had service for the duration of April but in May I realised that I had no internet connection. I thought there was something wrong with either the router or sim card because I was unaware that the money was not collect. On the 25th of May, I inserted the sim card in my phone and it is only then that I learned my line has been suspended. And when I called, I learned that indeed it was suspended due to non-payment.
