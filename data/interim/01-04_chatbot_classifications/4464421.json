Told the agent I needed data and would buy my airtime separately. We even discussed how my airtime would expire after 3 months as I worried if it expired in 30 days I would be wasting my money. I seldom make calls and send an sms so just wanted to buy as needed. All good, or so I thought! I wondered why my sms\u2019s were undelivered and today called. A waste of time when you get put through to a robot! Chatted to 2 people and went into a branch and all I got was \u201cyour contract doesn\u2019t let you buy airtime!\u201d Excuse me!!!! This was clearly what I asked for and thought I had. Why would someone never need airtime, never send / receive sms\u2019s (especially from a bank) and never have to make a call? If I cancel my contract I have to pay a fee! Now I must wait until 1/7 to have it changed and then to a pathetic plan. Why do the agents get away with lying to the customers? Vodacom can check my recording of my conversation. They can then hear that I specifically stated I needed a data plan and would buy my own airtime!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
