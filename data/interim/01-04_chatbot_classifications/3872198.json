They are by far the most irritating part about moving into the future. And ehere it starts for mebis vodacom. Tobi is a C@#t. I am sorry to say i ewill be leaving Vodacom just because of him. I dont want to speak to a machine. And i can not get through to a human. And Vodacom are stealing from me and they hope because i dont speak to a  human my problem goes away and i just leave it. Well sorry for them i will post a fantastic review like this for the rest of my life telling everyone how kak they are. \nHell man i am a programmer , i will right a multiplying bot that will post on the internet where ever it can how kak they are.  I will do this g i am not contacted and my data and airtime is not replaced within one hour. The board of directors are all monkeys and they should go back to the zoo. And we should get the baboons there to come run vodacom. They will definitely do a better job and that will save more than 1000 call centre staff.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
