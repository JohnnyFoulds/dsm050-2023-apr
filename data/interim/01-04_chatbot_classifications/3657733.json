My airtime keeps on disappearing on my telkom mobile Sim card. I tried to call Telkom customer service to cancel any subscription that exist on my number.\n\nTo my surprise, the customer care line is automated (robot). There is no option to talk to a customer agent. Also, all the options provided by the automated machine don't address my concerns.\nOn the telkom mobile app, there is no help as well.\nI think am gonna move to another service provider.\nThis is **** service.", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
