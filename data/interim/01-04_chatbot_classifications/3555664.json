They proceeded to ask me questions that I honestly answered and the agent sounded like she is new and did not now how to do her job. Now I'm requested to go to a cell c outlet which is far so I have to use more money to get there and I'm currently at work. I'm not happy with the support I received and I hope they inform their cusotmers in the future because I cannot work without my active number which is **********.
