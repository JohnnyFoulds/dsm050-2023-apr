For months now my husband and I have been trying to upgrade our phones.  Every time we get a call from a Consultant wanting to do the upgrade, we are then told the account is in arrears.  The account has been paid, and is paid, every month on the 25th.  It is now the 31st, almost a week after payment has been made, and the accounts department has still not captured this payment.  When calling subscriber collections you are lucky if you get to speak to someone.  I have tried three times this morning alone, and when the call is answered it is dropped.  You may be lucky to tell them what you are calling about, but before they can give you any assistance the call is dropped.  It seems that Vodacom really does not want our business.  I am getting so tired of having to phone Vodacom to tell them to allocate our payments.  I am getting so tired of trying to upgrade a phone.  I am getting so tired of never being able to speak to a person.  I am tired of being referred to TOBI their robot - who still does not get it right.  I want action, and I want it now.  Vodacom, you are providing a service, if you feel that you are not up to the task I will go with another service provider.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
