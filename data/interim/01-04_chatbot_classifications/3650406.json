ONLY to be sent a sms the next day from another vodacom marketing team to which I have to sent \"STOP\" to now sign out of this one.\n\nNow when trying to call ANYONE at vodacom to assist with this you are now faced with a chat bot which sends you around in circles.\n\nOnce someone at Vodacom sees this message I would like to once again officially state it in writing. I DO NOT WANT TO RECEIVE ANY MARKETING/ADVERTISING. If I have a query about a product or offering, I WILL BE IN CONTACT WITH YOU. \nwith many witnesses now to this statement and request as a consumer.\n\nEagerly awaiting a non bot response from Vodacom on the above issue", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
