This customer service agent eventually blocked my number so i cant call vodacom for assistance!!! i have tried everyday since the 1st of October but with no success as i keep getting directed to TOBI the most useless customer servicing BOT that cannot even use its AI to assist with my query... For the past 2 years of being on this contract i have had no issues but now that i do have an issue created by my so called service provider their customer services are pathetic!!!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
