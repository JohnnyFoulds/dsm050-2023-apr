Days later again I phone cell c to reduce my spend limit as it has depleted R10.56 at the time and the agent promised to carry the instruction. Today I check my app and cell c did not  reduce the spend limit and they claim I have already used R76.76 and they can\u2019t assist me. In the past I have asked cell c to reduce my spend limit and there has never been a mistake for them not to reduce a spend limit. Now that I am canceling my contract with useless \u2018cell sea\u2019 and they want to milk everything and anything because they have financial troubles. Anyone who plan to take contract with \u2018cell Sea\u2019 keep in mind that you will be subjected to their rude consultants who behave like robots and their non existent team leaders and management. This cell sea is more corrupt than the South African government. Cell c staff members have milked the company and now we must pay the price today. Their employees have inflated tender prices and now we have to suffer. Here is proof on why cell sea today is limping and how come auditors never saw this https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timeslive.co.za/amp/news/south-africa/2021-01-22-former-cell-c-executive-arrested-in-connection-with-r64m-fraud/. If you are planning to sign up with cell sea keep in mind their prices increase without notification and cell c change their products without consulting or offering you options to choose from. Keep in mind cell sea staff member will lock your simcard if they can\u2019t resolve your query and you are breathing at their neck. It makes sense why cell sea has migrated its customers to the two big networks. They don\u2019t have resources and skill to handle such and you as a customer you should be asking yourself why do you buy vodacom or MTN when you can go directly to them and have better service", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
