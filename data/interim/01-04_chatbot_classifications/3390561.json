Then upon wanting to open a new contract this year I get told I have bad credit because I have an outstanding account with Vodacom. I got told to phone customer care to sort it out, I phone and get told to go back to the store so that they can do a decline review on the system. I go back to the store for the fourth time, being made aware that on the system the account is stating that is has been settled. They can't decline review, I must now phone the accounts department to get a settlement letter. I phone and request it on the 1st Feb, by the 2nd Feb I get an sms stating that the issue has been resolved and closed, I still have no email with the settlement letter. I phone the afternoon of the 2nd and was told it will be sent the 3rd. I receive nothing for a whole week and when trying to phone the accounts department again, the robot talking says that the number I'm phoning about has already phoned that day and that a consultant will phone back. I go back to another Vodacom store and they get through to the accounts department, I am assured that the letter will be sent through in less than 24hours because they had an incorrect email address, this was after giving the email address to 2 different consultants. The next day there is still no email from Vodacom with a settlement letter. I phone the accounts department again and am cut off 3 times by consultants without resolving the issue. It has now been 14 days waiting for Vodacom to fix a mistake they made in the first place. Another thing that I have made Vodacom aware of multiple times is that I receive the invoices and statements of another customer and it still has not been resolved after 3 or more years.", "suggestion": "Vodacom should prioritize resolving the outstanding account issue and provide the settlement letter promptly.
