However, I have been making payments as expected. \n\nI receive my statements every month via email. For a while now I noticed that my sim card is active and there is someone using it. I contacted Telkom via call but there is nobody to attend to customers, only a chatbot. \nI therefore contacted Telkom via Facebook at the beginning of February to try and block the sim card. \n\nUnfortunately Telkom didn't block the sim card but I noticed on my latest statement that the sim card is still being used meaning I am paying for someone else to use my sim card. \n\nThis matter is worse because Telkom stores are closed around my area.
