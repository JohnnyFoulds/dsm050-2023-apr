And its now 2 weeks a sim swop and nobody can help to activate the simcard. Used my router with MTN, Rain and 2 other sim cards and it works. But this 100gig is just something that is *****ing money and no one seems to be able to help you. But its an active contract on your profile but the simplest thing is the most useless thing they seem to not master and activate the sim. Now I have to sit with a consultant that also contacts customer care and still nothing is happening. You are costing me money because I get paid by the hour, you are costing me money because i can not work from home and you are making false promises to customers. And please get someone that speaks english and not selfone jargon. I and millions of people want to understand what is being explained. And doing that security check like a 100 times over and over and over and speaking to a ****** robot is realy annoying.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
