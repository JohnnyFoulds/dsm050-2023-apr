This data has never been used and I am sure you can track that.\n\nThe 3rd party that you utilize tried to renew the contract last year which is when I informed them I did not want to and they can cancel at the end of the term (being around June last year). They were not happy as I had a Rain solution in place so their solution wasnt required.\n\nNow Vodacom tells me it was never cancelled and that the 3rd party cant cancel my contract when they are the ones that signed me up, and I was not informed that I would still be billed for a service I was no longer using.\n\nI would like to speak to a person (not a robot) to have this sorted out.\n\nThanks", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
