Obviously. I however immediately entered into a payment arrangement via their TOBI bot on Whatsapp (screenshots will confirm same). Today I was service blocked despite such payment arrangement because to no surprise the payment arrangement through the bot does not reflect on their system. What is the use of the bot or the payment arrangement then? The 2nd time in as many weeks that I had absolutely horrific service from vodacom and I am seriously contemplating terminating my relationship with them! Making calls is an integral part of my day to day work duties, which now came to a halt.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
