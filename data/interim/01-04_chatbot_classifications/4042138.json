Brits ID no. **********081) would like to submit a complaint regarding a upgrade contract deal in March at Sasolburg MTN of a Xiaomi 11T Pro with INCLUDED a pair of wireless earphones and a Mi Robot vacuum mop.\n\nI unfortunately have not received my Mi Robot mop and it was included in the deal that i based my decision on. \n\nAfter numerous calls, i cannot accept that there is no stock from xiaomi seeing that my contract is with mtn and not xiaomi.\n\nI was not informed on the day of upgrade that there is no stock and therefore selected the contract based on everything included.\n\nThe lady at MTN Sasolburg said the vacuum must be ordered separately after i phoned her and said only the phone and earphones were delivered.\n\nThe worst part is that i am a mtn customers for almost 20 years\n\nPlease resolve the issue.", "business_slug": "mtn"}}
