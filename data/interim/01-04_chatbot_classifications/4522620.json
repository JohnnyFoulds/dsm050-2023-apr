On the 14th I called customer service but was referred to TOBI the BOT, of which it was hard for TOBI to understand because he is an Automated Machine, I then asked to speak to a human, with no success. Sent an email to customer care, got a reference but no call back. I went to Sandton branch, but they could not help me because I bought the data online via capitec app. Can we please speak to humans, its really tiring not being able to express yourself. Kindly serve your customers well, this is really frustrating.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
