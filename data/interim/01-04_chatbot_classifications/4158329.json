How can it be so difficult to get an agent to speak to me?? I have been on the phone for over 30mins trying  different options, in hope that I will get an option to speak to a real human being, not this Tobi robot. Tobi can be very frustrated, he does not have all the options I want. Just to cancel an online application has taken me over 30mins. This is not right! we need the agent option still on the voice prompt. I am typing this and I am still on the phone waiting for an agent from the \"online\" department.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
