After 2 weeks they finally decided my joint bank account with my husband is causing issues and he now needs to submit forms as well alon with ID. This done we were told we will have an answer the next day. Come next day oh no sorry Wiehan only copied front of ID both sides is needed. We emailed a new copy of ID and again told by end of today you will have your contract. Again no feedback and we went back to store only to be told still pending. This pending process took 5 days. Finally I received message that contract is approved, but still no feedback from Wiehan. We went there today to sign and collect phone, no phone in sight. Turns out they only ordered.the phone last week after tellin me it was order when we did application.
