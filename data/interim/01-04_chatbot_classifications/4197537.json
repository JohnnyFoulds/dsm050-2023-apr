Its like paying a game..... Every answer you give is like finishing a level on CandyCrush.\n\nFunny how you can speak to a human if you call for insurance or something they try sell to you. And how easily they contact you if there is a problem with payment on your account.\n\nBut as soon as you require service... TOBI.... No option to speak to a real human so the option you want is never there.\nYippy you have a bot that can work on voice commands!!! Lol.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
