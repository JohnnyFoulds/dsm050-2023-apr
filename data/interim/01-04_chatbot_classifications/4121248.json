Today finally swap my number back but now there was air time advanced of R200 done and transferred to another number which they can't help me find out or it's no appearing on their system. I'm told I'm liable to pay for the advance taken and transferred by the fraudsters. It was their useless TOBI that did the sim swap and I'm expected to bay for their **** up?? How does that work. I will not pay a cent to them. they must just get rid of Tobi the useless robot idiot and bring back my airtime balance of R149 that initially in my account.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
