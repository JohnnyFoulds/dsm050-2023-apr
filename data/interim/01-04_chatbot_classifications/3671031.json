I have in the past reached out to Vodacom to remove the song. I went into a Vodashop for assistance, I dialed the numbers to opt out of the subscription, I've cancelled the subscription on the My Vodacom app. Nowhere did I find joy. What's most annoying is that if I don't go into a Vodashop to speak to a consultant,  all I have is a useless bot that has standardised responses that don't help anyone. Only time you speak to an actual person is when they're trying to sell you more things you don't need. Or you owe them. \n\nPlease, advise on how to remove this song from my line. My employment is being affected.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
