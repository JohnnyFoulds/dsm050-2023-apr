My line just went down on Thursday 31/03 evening, thought it was no big deal and that it would come back. By Friday morning, still not back, called them in the evening when I was close to the router, turns out that it is an authentication error, so, totally their fault. BUT, the guys who can fix it only work Monday - Friday, so I was doomed to spending the whole weekend with no access, all the consultants could say was \"sorry for the inconvenience\", like robots. Come Monday (04/04) and still no word, sitting with no internet. I guess I'm still paying for this service then even though I can't use it? I also asked them to set up a debit on my account, not done! Also asked them to increase my line speed to 100/100, also not done but I guess I'm paying for the 'upgrade' as well. \nI had Telkom LTE for 5 years and that was never down for more than a few hours, what's your excuse Cell C?", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
