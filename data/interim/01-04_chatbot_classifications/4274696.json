We have had no internet connection for four days.  After countless calls, e mails and online enquiry tickets, only one returned e mail from a call Centre agent (I think, seemed like a robot in the way he addressed me).  And not even addressing the problem at hand.  This company does not even deserve 1 star.  Wish I could put a minus.  E mail response we received ended with a \"Cheers\" and no name.  After requesting call backs,  nothing.  On one specific call we were told the technician would contact us,  when we asked if that would indeed happen we were told.  \"I don't know\".  Worst of all.  We paid in advance for this service so I suspect this company does not give a damn if they do not provide the service. I mean they already received the money.  This seems to be a scam of sorts.", "business_slug": "rain-internet-service-provider"}}
