I wanted to port my MTN pre paid number to Cell c, and followed the instructions on the new Cell C sim card, and Rica the card and then sent the Rica serial numer to the 084 number provided on the packaging but no reply whatsoever, bo confirmation and no porting happened. I did this 4 times. Still nothing as if the number does not work.\n\nIt seems I must bow maybe port to Vodacom because Cell c service is really non existent and the porting instructions on the starter pack packaging does not work.", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
