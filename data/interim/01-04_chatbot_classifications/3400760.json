On the bureau's side the Vodacom account reflected as active and not closed, while all the amounts were settled. I received a call from a Vodacom agent who thereafter forwarded the message to Vodacom accounts department. He assured me that I would receive a letter confirming the closure of this account once the accounts department had done so. I was to count 5-7 working days. Up until now I have not received any communication from the Vodacom accounts department of having this matter resolved. There is no direct line to reach Vodacom, except robots to try deal with my query. Vodacom's failure to close the Vodacom account when it was settled is placing me in a negative credit record with the bureau. Vodacom is also not following up with me as the person at the receiving end. If this is not solved I will have report it to the Ombudsman as my credit rating is being tarnished and I cannot buy a property in the near future. ", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
