It's a great example of a failed application of artificial intelligence. One needs to be on the line for at least 85 minutes, trying to bypass the Toby robot which is a complete waste of time, then get bounced around at least 7 departments until you get to the Customer Care. \n\nThey still have the 082 135 number on invoices, only to be told the number is no longer in use.\n\nAll in all, it's a painful exercise to get a service one pays for. \n\nHighly inefficient and a great inconvenience. Please fix this!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
