I was surprised that it is a mtn sim, my wife did not know either. I destroyed the simcard immediately and thought nothing of it. Month end zap debit order off her account. I tried to sort at mtn. What a bust, they could not help me. After 4 months i finally got the company who the account was opened. Rewardsco or aka mondo connect. Struggled for 2 months with them talking to cyber robots sending emails and statements etc etc etc. Finally get told it was escalated to mtn fraud dept. Answer within 2 to 9 days. 3 weeks later i just get told that mtn fraud is busy with it. At a place where i physically applied for credit i got told that i was listed at the credit bereau too. Try phoning mtn from another phone namely 083135, nothing. There is no choice or a chance to talk to a consultant. You get cut off regularly when phoning the head office on ********** or get put to the means nothing menu. Customer care my backside man. I am so glad i have been with cell c for 14 years and they have treated me very good. Mtn can go learn from them espcially from the menus.", "business_slug": "mtn"}}
