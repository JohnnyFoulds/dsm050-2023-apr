Was transferred so that I can get the block removed  now I must wait 2 hours and try again. I have been with Vodacom for over 25 years. I think it is time to change my service provider.  There was a ad on FB advertising upgrades I thought the questions and answers were vague only to find out I was communicating with a robot. How is it possible for a company the size of vodacom to survive giving such bad service", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
