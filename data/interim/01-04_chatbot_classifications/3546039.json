I called in a month ago and was told that deliveries are delayed - seriously??  That's nonsense.\n\nI don't believe Vodacom even services products from this store.  It's a lie.  I try calling the call centre, and after being redirected through various options, then a stupid chatbot that adds no value other than sending you in circles, I eventually get to the option to be routed to a call centre agent, then as I get dial tone, it cuts me off after 10 minutes of waiting to get through.\n\nI spent 2000 Vodabucks for a new handset and no word of it in 2 months.\n\nDo NOT use your Vodabucks - it's a scam!!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
