I'm trying to cancel my contract which expired on 30/06 22. Five times I've tried on 084143. The number goes to customer care. They ask 100security questions and then say they'll transfer me to cancellations. When they do the line cuts - the more I tell the agent this is not working the more they babble on about something that doesn't work, ie 084143. I even asked the agent to ask the cancellations department to call me. It seems they cant even do that . What a frustrating 30 minutes. I genuinely can't wait to cancel my remaining two contracts as well when they expire.", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
