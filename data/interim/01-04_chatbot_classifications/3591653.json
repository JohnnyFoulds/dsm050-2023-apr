The item was then out of stock and I have trying to get my refund since then.\n\nNumerous calls later having spoken to amongst many others, Thabang and her supervisor Anastacia Ndlovu at Vodacom Rewards but to no avail.\n\nThen there are times that you call Vodacom Customer Support and you hold for ages, then you get diverted without you requesting it, to the Bot who has no clue what you are talking about. The Bot then says that you will called back by an agent which never happens.\n\nTrying to speak to Vodacom is the most frustrating thing. And they are supposed to be in communications??\n\nNot sure if they just want to steal my money.\n\nAll because of this, I am going to cancel contracts with Vodacom. Imagine if I have a cellular related problem?? Will it also take 3 weeks without assistance.\n\nI have no option but to maybe escalate to ICASA.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
