The fact that it was bypassed and Vodacom allowed it makes it *****ulent. We want all airtime taken reversed. When sending query to customer care, we are forced to chat to Tobi the robot instead of human. How can you explain the query to a robot? Is it because this is a prepaid number? Please contact my dad and refund him his airtime used for this content service. I deactivate it on the app again as it was definitely active.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
