On Tuesday the 2nd of August 2022, I tried to make a call, only to be answered by a bot stating that my number has been suspended. I then used my wife's number to contact customer service and I was told to contact the fraud department or visit my nearest Vodacom store, of which I did the latter. On Wednesday the 3rd of August 2022 I went to Vodacom chatz, Jakaranda centre. I was asked to produce my ID and proof of residence, which I did and was told that my line will be reactivated in 24 hour, now the time frame has passed and my line is yet to operate. What ticks me off is that Vodacom is failing to give me an answer as to why my line was suspended. I use this number for almost everything, I can't even transact because of this inconvenience from Vodacom, nor receive one-time access messages on my banking apps. This is unprofessional.", "suggestion": "Vodacom should provide a clear explanation for the suspension of the customer's line and take immediate action to reactivate it.
