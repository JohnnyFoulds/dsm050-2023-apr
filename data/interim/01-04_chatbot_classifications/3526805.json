They never respond on emails and it's near impossible to get through to a consultant by phone, nevermind the very badly developed self help bot on their website.\n\nIt's amazing how when I signed up with them their sales department is on point and readily available, but once your signed up, that's where all forms of care for their customers just stop.\n\nI'm pretty sure if I cancel my debit order to them, it wouldn't be more than a day before they contact me.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
