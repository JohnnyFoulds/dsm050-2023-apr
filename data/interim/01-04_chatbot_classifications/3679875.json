Literally everyone I have spoken to from Cell C doesn't seem to be sure of what they are doing! I gave notification to cancel my contract on the 2nd of August, which I was advised it would take 30 calendar days, as also stated on my contract, which would be the 31st of August but the agent went ahead to make my cancellation effective on the 2nd of September. Now I don't know which calendar they are using at Cell C, it must be a special one. I was billed for September, for services that I did not even use, and when I queried it, I was told that they don't have access to my statement as my contract was cancelled. Now I don't know how you send me a statement and have the audacity to tell me you don't have access to it, that's just absurd. I send them the statement, then they tell me there is no refund due to me, the statement must reflect a balance in credit, I decide to just let it be because it was frustrating, it's like speaking to a rock, they are computerised robots with a limited number of responses, they tell you the same thing over and over again and you can tell that they don't understand the query, even their \"managers\" are useless. Finally I receive a statement that shows I'm in credit in my account, which means a refund is due to me, I call them again and I send them the statement, but still they can't get to the bottom of the issue. It has been 7 weeks now dealing with the same issue and it's becoming rather annoying, don't you have specialists or SMEs who know what they are doing? This is just bulls**t!
