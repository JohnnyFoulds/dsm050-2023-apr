I appreciate their efforts in improving customer service.\n\nI ,however, have a big concern with how readily available a customer's info is. Today I had to access my PUK number and I used Vodacom's chatbot Tobi via my laptop.\n\nTobi did not even verify who I was, I was just prompted to input the cell number I needed the PUK for and wallllaaaa! Tobi gave me the PUK!\n\nI was thrilled for a second then it hit me that actually anyone who has my number can get my PUK this easily!. It could be a thief, a scammer or a hacker with malicious intent.\n\nVodacom, this for me is a safety concern and I feel that your customer's information is not held with the highest confidentiality.\n\nBalance me on this one please.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
