I paid the account on the 6th July including the R100.xx penalty fee, Via the vodacom app.\n\nSince then i am being hounded daily for money on all my contract numbers, which is highly embarrassing as now people think i dont pay my bills. i have called the  ********** contact number now numerous times where they all tell me to send the POP to ***********,za, explained to them numerous times i have already done so, i finally got an answer to state there is a note on the system it has been sent for allocation. low and behold i get spammed again on all 4 numbers this morning claiming i am in arrears call the ********** number -- you have reached us outside business hours. get the idiotic bot Tobi to get a call back from customer service, get to this genius Aboheng, that is as rude as she is incompetent. i get told at customer service they only deal with customers that is in a current balance not in arrears. i ask to speak to a manager or supervisor, i get told there is no manager or supervisor as it is weekend.\n\nhonestly Vodacom, pathetic. i expect a call back from a Manager @ Vodacom and expect the allocation to be done on Monday Morning with a formal apology. \n\nAs this has now impacted my credit rating as well, because someone can not allocate payments", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
