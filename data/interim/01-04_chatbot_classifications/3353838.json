The introduction of your chatbot has made it impossible for your customers to inter act with call center agents when facing queries that are not generic in nature.\n\nI attempted to buy a voice bundle via your app but it failed to load my bundle but managed successfully debit my account.\n\nWhen trying to get help, your chatbot Tobi will not be able to assist me.
