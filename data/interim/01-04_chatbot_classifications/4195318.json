All I'm getting is a list of reference numbers and no service. They keep on saying reset the router or we've escalated the matter but I'm still suffering from a poor connection. If the router doesn't restart on its own, it's the buffering. My signal strength is between -96 to -138 dBm and they telling me all is well on their side. Their call centre agents are like robots just repeating the same thing. I'm so frustrated right now if there was a better option for wireless internet I would've dropped them immediately. I wouldn't recommend anyone to get any of their 5G subscriptions. I had hope on a dying horse. Ek is gatvol really.", "business_slug": "rain-internet-service-provider"}}
