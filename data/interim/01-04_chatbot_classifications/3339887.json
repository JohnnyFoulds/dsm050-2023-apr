Vodacom then just blocked my numbers on the 26th without even trying to debit my account or contacting me. I then called and arranged ANOTHER debit order which did actually go off on the 28th of December. \n\nIt is now the 4th of January and my lines are still blocked. Vodacom's call center does not answer phones, Kept on hold for 1 hour 15 mins until I gave up. I have left 2 messages to call me back. Their chatbot does not respond, their online chat is offline. What is going on over there?\n\nI cannot make any other calls other than 135 (which they do not answer)\n\nIt is my last resort to leave a review on hellopeter as I don't know what else to do.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
