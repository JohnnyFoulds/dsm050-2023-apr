Yes, good to go the bot route but it will be good to connect with HUMANS who know what is going on within the industry.\nI have been trying to enquire; or perhaps take out a data package with MTN but I guess they do not need another customer right!!! yes, it is very frustrating to deal with a communications company that does not call back or care about prospective customers.\nI guess this is basically stating, DO NOT TAKE A CONTRACT WITH MTN!!!!!!!!!", "business_slug": "mtn"}}
