I am very annoyed. I applied at your vodacom 4u Berea east london branch for a double up iPhone. Thr lady said they don't have stock of the phone but can put through 2 new additional lines on my current package. Long story short for some reason she said only 1 approved. I told her that I'm disappointed with vodacom for only approving 1 but I will then do the double up online. I told them to cancel the approval I'll do the double up online. I am now blocked doing it online as they have an approval and decline they need to uplift so I can do the online order on the double up. I have been a conract customer since 2007 and this has been by far the worse service I have received. \n\nSince this morning the branch is just ignoring me and my request to cancel. I am speaking to someone on your fb messagnger who seems to be a robot! I also see vodacom did 4 credit checks on me yesterday without my permission. \n\nI will be taking this further. I also want to know who I can contact to cancel my 5 packages I have and what needs to be paid so I may move to another network.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
