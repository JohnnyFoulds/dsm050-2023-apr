I was informed by the lady who took my call that the last debit order would be at the end of February 2023. On 2 March I noticed that this contract has not been cancelled. I AGAIN phoned Cancellations and the woman that answered the call was extremely rude telling me that the no. does not belong to me and said to phone the billing department. I phoned Billing and gave the exact details that I gave to this unmannered woman at cancellations and the lady tried assisting but said I have to contact Cancellations. Another call (and 1 hour later!!!!!!) I spoke to Mvelo who informed me that the contract was not cancelled instead the lady that I spoke to on 3/1/23 cancelled A CANCELLED CONTRACT OF A YEAR AGO!!!!! How incompetent. Mvelo assured me that the matter will be escalated and I will receive feedback with 48 hours. Needless to say, NO FEEDBACK!!!!!!! This is totally unacceptable and I WILL NOT be held liable for Vodacom\u2019s incompetency. Should this matter not be resolved IMMEDIATELY, I will report this to ICASA! As Vodacom\u2019s robot informs you ALL CALLS ARE BEING RECORDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I suggest you go listen to the recordings AND REVERT BACK IMMEDIATELY.
