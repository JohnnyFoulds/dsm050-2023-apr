I am overseas. I deposited R55. I had them, through their useless BOT, phone me to explain. They cut the call and THEY TOOK MY DEPOSIT without explanation or justification. I deposited another R34 and they again took R30 without any explanation. R5 in all was in respect of SMS's. Accepted. I've used SMS's over the years that I have been overseas to keep my account active, as Vodacom had instructed me to do. Now they require, I was told, R29 A MONTH TO KEEP MY ACCOUNT OPEN. Staff are shielded by this frustratingand, inadequate BOT of theirs to make them unavailabe to public enquiry. Here in the UK, the regulators would be onto them very quickly. Vodafone, their parent, does not behave in this manner. COME ON VODACOM ..... 25 YEARS OF MY CUSTOM and must I now resort to a complaint with ICASA?", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
