The order was placed online over two weeks ago. Since then, I can not track my order and when logged on it indicates my order does not exist. I call in to the Vodacom Sales And Upgrades number **********4 with no success. Either no one answers or constant drop calls.\nI then tried the online chat bot. The consultant Jared Tremaine Stolls does not even engage me. Instead he closes the chat without finding out what the problem is.\nTo date, I have had constant headaches trying to contact Vodacom regarding the upgrade.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
