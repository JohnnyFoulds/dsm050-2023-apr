In the past, before there were all these different data and smart phone option, Vodacom used to issue an additional contract and number for the data routers.  The data number and contract that I had for a couple of years now, was due for an upgrade in July 2021.  However, because I now subscribe to a 5G network, I have no need for the continuation of this specific number and have been trying to instruct Vodacom cancel my data number and contract.  This, however seems an impossible task.  I have tried a Vodadcom Shop, they referred me to the number 082 135 and **********.  Following the voice prompts, you seem to go in circles.  Towards the end of July, I eventually managed to get through to a \"person\" and all she wanted to do was provide me with other promotions.  I tried again today to verify if the contract was cancelled through the myVodacom portal, the above two numbers and the chatbot Tobi.  1 hour later, and I am none the wiser.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
