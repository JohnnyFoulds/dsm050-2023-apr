I have a data contract ending on 2 September 2021. I phone on 30th July to cancel it and am told if I cancel in July I will have to pay for the whole month of September but if I cancel in August I won't. So today I duly try again to cancel this contract but am told I will still pay for the whole of September, although my contract ends on 2/9/21???????  Not sure if anyone at Vodacom can count or calculate but it is 24 months without paying for September 2021 and I am giving a month's notice.  \nWould appreciate feedback from Vodacom because talking to a call centre agent is like speaking to a robot who has a list of replies .........", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
