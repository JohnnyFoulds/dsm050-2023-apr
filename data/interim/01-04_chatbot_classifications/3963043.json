(Even from outside S.A.) The stupid TOBI robot on their site does not work on a computer. Ony on a mobile device. the so called \"Customer Care\" e-mail address has been discontinued.\nSurely someone must be curious about why there are no inquiries arriving on their idiot robot chat.\nI can see from al the reviews that I signed up with the WRONG company.\nAs soon as I get back to SA - I am closing my account of 15 years - and getting another Provider.\n***** You - Vodacom. Thanks for nothing.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
