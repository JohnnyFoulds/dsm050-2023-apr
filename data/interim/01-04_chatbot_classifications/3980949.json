You certainly have no way of complaining to someone that can do something about it. Anyway here my complaint sent to them. It is self explanatory.\n\nDear Vodacom......I do not even know why I am bothering with this email as it will probably be swept under the rug like everything else.\n\nI tried your so called \u201cCUSTOMER DON'T CARE\u201d number but it sends me to a BOT (because everyone is busy) that just goes round in circles seeing as the correct \u201cCHOICE\u201d is not available.\nI tried the BOT on the internet BUT it gets stuck and tells me to call \u201cCUSTOMER DON'T CARE\u201d number. Another circle.\nClicking on \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d has no reaction on your site.\nI few days ago I got through to a HUMAN (Imagine that)\u2026..but, alas, they were clueless and I got the wrong info.\n\nIs Vodacom now also being managed by the government?\nIs there NO way one can complain about rubbish service?\n\nTo make it worse the question is not even difficult.\n\nI purchased a prepaid sim.\nIt does not work in my tracking device. \n\nUpon getting support from the manufacturer they tell me to:\n\"Please ask the operator what the APN of the new SIM card is, and the user name and password of the APN\u201d\nNow that seems a reasonable request\u2026..except that my OPERATOR is clueless.\n\nSo here goes. An email that will probably not be answered or sent from pillar to post.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
