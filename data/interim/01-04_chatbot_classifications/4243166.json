I had a call from Vodacom last month as my current package has \u201cexpired\u201d. The consultant offered me a lower package at R400 with more data and of course I accepted as this is lower than I am currently paying. I received an sms this morning telling me that my premium is now almost R300 more that what I was advised. I have tried to contact Vodacom since before 8am on all platforms, from calling them to requesting call backs to trying to chat to \u2018Lu****a Hlomza\u2019 on the TOBi chat bot who ended the chat without responding to my query? \n\nAfter speaking to different consultants on 4 calls who promise to assist and escalate, I finally get through to a nice gent who transfers me through to after sales so that they are able to cancel this \u201cpackage upgrade\u201d. Knowing that they are likely short-staffed I gladly stay on hold for over an hour to have someone drop the call. As I\u2019m typing this, this is probably my 6 or 7th call Nd I have been waiting for a consultant for 20 minutes already.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
