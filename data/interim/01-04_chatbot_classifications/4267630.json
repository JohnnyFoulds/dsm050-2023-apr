An advance of R140 against my numbers was taken and transferred along with my airtime by the criminals to their numbers and vodacom promised to cancel the advance and a reference number was issued for my case, 7 days down the line I'm still owing the R140 advance nothing has been done to atleast cancel the advance, when i call their consultants they say i must wait 7 working days for feedback. I can't even access mobile banking because i dont have airtime and i can't  make fonecalls ,the least i expected vodacom to do was to expedite the advance \ncancellation since it is their fault that this stupid TOBI technology is so weak that criminals are now able to manipulate it to do sim swaps, but no im told to wait 7 working days for feedback. I am not going to buy back that advance from my own pocket for their fault, never. I wish i could switch to other networks,  it's a pity that im stuck with this useless network because most of my things are linked to my vodacom numbers,  but one day things will change. WOE TO VODACOM, N***R", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
