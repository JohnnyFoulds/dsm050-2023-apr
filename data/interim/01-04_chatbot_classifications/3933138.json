Hopefully this will get their marketing departments attention:\n\nThe adverti*****ts on Vodacom's website do not match the Vodacom brochure. \n\nWhen I click on \"callback\" I am presented with a website error. \n\nWhen I click on chat, I have to speak to a useless chatbot that does not present the options I am looking for. \n\nWhen I call custom service I am only given new phone numbers to call. Eventually I got hold of the contract department, but they seem to only have 1 agent who is completely clueless and don't even know what Vodacom is selling. I ask for property data package with a router he tells me they don't sell routers. I ask for a SIM only, he gives me the router packages?!? As ask for unlimited data,  he gives me the unlimited minutes package. I ask for data-only contract he tells me that is not possible for a home office, because he only sells Home Internet?!? Please train your employees better.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
