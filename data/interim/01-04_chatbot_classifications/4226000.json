In my order confirmation, it states a router is included in the deal. \n\nI called Vodacom 5 times on the 1st of December and even tried the chatbot and no one was able to assist me, they kept telling me the router is not included and then transferred me to another department and the lady I spoke to via the online chat, just ignored me completely after I explained my problem. \n\nA few days later and I decided to call in, I was asked to send an email in to customer support saying the order I placed was not what I received. I sent an email to customer support and did not receive a response to date.\n\nI contacted Vodacom today(14th December) for assistance and I spoke to the rudest person on the phone, her name was Melissa, and she claimed to be working for Vodacom for the past 12 years. I'm really disappointed in the service I'm receiving regarding this matter. People like that give y'all business a very bad reflection.", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
