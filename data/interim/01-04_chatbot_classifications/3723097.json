The bot on Vodacom Facebook messenger, denies that it is a bot, and that only humans work there. \nIf that is the case, could we please re-consider Vodacom's facebook slogan. \nTechnology can take us far but with the power of humanity, we are able to go #FurtherTogether. \nBots are able to respond, but cannot assist.\nThe humans are possibly able to assist, if one could reach them.\nBut they do not respond. \nAnd if and when they do after hours and hours of struggling to reach them, it's all:  \"We're sorry for your inconvenience, but I am also unable to assist.\"", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
