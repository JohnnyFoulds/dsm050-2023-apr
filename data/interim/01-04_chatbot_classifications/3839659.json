We have had it for just about 2 months.\n\n12 am on Tuesday we suddenly had no signal.\nI have since then spoken to 3 different Telkom employees and nothing comes of it. \nAll relevant details were sent to them as well as screenshots os the issue and a picture of what the device is displaying which is quite obviously... NO signal.\nAnd everytime I am redirected back to Karabo the Telkom bot and the employee in question disappears. \n\n*we have inserted a vodacom sim and there was perfect signal.\n*inserted Telkom sim card - no signal\n*there is nothing wrong with the sim card as it works in our phones. \n\nWe have purchased R400 worth of data that will expire after 31 days however we can't access that data. \nThis is unacceptable. \n\nThere are many other Telkom customers complaining about the exact same issue on Telkom's facebook page. All of them stating more or less that the network went doen on tuesday around 12am. \n\nWhy ia nothing being done as the problem is clearly on Telkom's side?\n\nFix the issue or refund my R400 so that I can get another sim card from a different service provider and bin the telkom sim.", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
