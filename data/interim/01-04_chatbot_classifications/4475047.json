Their app is faulty, so you cannot help yourself. Then you need to wrestle with the call center which is shockingly bad. The bot prompts are often incorrect, so when you eventually do get to speak to a human being, it's usually the wrong one. As an added bonus my phone calls have stopped working, I now get scratching or silence. My data has run out, I am unable to recharge via the app because their OTPs aren't  working and I am unable to recharge via the call center because their coverage in my area has met a tragic demise so I can't phone. Those are literally the two things I need them for.\n\nAdd that I have had to block most of their numbers due to their incessant phoning, I used to get around 10 marketing calls a day. That's really borderline harassment. \n\nWhen eventually I do get another contract, it most definitely will not be with Telkom.", "business_slug": "telkom"}}
