The past 2 months of calling them has been the most painful customer service experience I've had in a long time. I would rate them in the same league as the south african post office. I'm happy my contract is finished. I've been with them for more than 10 years but its not the same company. \nI'm not an advocate for replacing people with robotic services but the hell I've endured with the people at Cell C's customer service.......", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
