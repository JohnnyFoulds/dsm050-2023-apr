Technical department never responds so every time you call they take you through the same steps. It is clear that they have not connected me to the nearest satellites to my area but not even the supervisors can pick up the phone and call the technical department. The technical department appears not to even check if their infrastructure is working correctly or they totally rely on AI to decide even if it doesn't work for customers.

They treat customers as technologically illerate while they fail even to collate a basic instruction pamphlet or leave room for complex problem-solving in their companies.
