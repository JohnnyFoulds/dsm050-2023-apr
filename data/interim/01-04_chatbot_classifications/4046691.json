However the consultant that was capturing my application made it the 10th. The debit order did not go through the first month and I had to make a cash payment, I contacted the call centre again and spoke to a different consultant who advised me that my date could not be changed within the first 3 months of my contract. I have been calling Telkoms contact centre every month to have this change as this is an inconvenience to me. The consultants do not care to help the clients but instead keep me reading me a script as if they are robots. I've asked numerous times to speak to the supervisor but not once have I had any luck getting through to them, it's like they don't exist. I am frustrated and appalled at the service I'm receiving from Telkom. Every consultant tells me there's nothing they can do and refuse to transfer me to their senior. I've never received such disgusting client service from an institution, it's like when other companies take their staff for service excellence they are trained on trying to outdo other companies with the worst service possible. The last call I made I spoke to Neliswa who decided to put the phone to the side while she continues with I don't know what until the call centre closes. I do not think it's fair that as a client they can't fix their mistake and I have to suffer for it. I have sent an email to Robyn who gave me a dispute no and told me to call after 3-7 working days and made calls but no one seems to want to assist me.
