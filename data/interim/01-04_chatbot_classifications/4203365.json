The consultant said I should use my MTN number till it shows No service and then insert the Vodacom sim and it should be activated. Yesterday, 29 Nov 2022, late afternoon my MTN showed no service, I inserted the Vodacom sim and it shows no service. I called the Vodacom call Centre numerous times last night only to get a robot service. I eventually got hold of a consultant at enquiries and he advised to phone the porting call Centre after 8AM this morning. I have just spoken to them and apparently Vodacom was not suppose to port my number on Monday as they were having porting issues, apparently they will escalate this now to the service department, but was advise that this will take another 24hours and when asked if they can port my number back to MTN I was advised that that it will take 72hours. I use my phone for work and now I am stuck for another 24hours, find this shocking!!!!!!!!!!!!", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
