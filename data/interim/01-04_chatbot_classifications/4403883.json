How could you shove a stupid AI security check in my face when I'm  trying to block a lost phone.  \nSo what if I can't remember the address I signed up with... my mistake here was staying with one network for too damn long.  The worst thing is there is no cell c branch I'm my small town so I'm stuck with call centre robots @ this point I'm ready to buy out my contract and go for the SPs with branches near me and won't use security checks that test my memory every time\n\nMaybe replace it with a DNA test", "business_slug": "cell-c"}}
