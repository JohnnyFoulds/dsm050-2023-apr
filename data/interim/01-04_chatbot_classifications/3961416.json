On a sailing trip to Namibia my phone fell overboard.\n\nI contacted vodacom as soon as we arrived to arrange for a sim swap. After many hours of talking with support, I was told the only way to do a sim swap was to purchase a new contract sim card and have it couriered to Namibia and then the swap could be done. I did so at great expense.\n\nI contacted Vodacom support again to complete the sim swap and I am now being told it is not possible! After all the costs and frustration the support agent refuses to assist and they keep referring me back to Tobi, Vodacoms robot assistant. I am fed up!\n\nSurelly I am not the first client to be stuck in a situation like this?", "business_slug": "vodacom"}}
