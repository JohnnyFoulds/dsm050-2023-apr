Then I get told that I could have got a much better package once I get through to the person on the other side. The question to Vodacom should you not look at your customers and sell them the best package according to their usage,  rather than just want to get them to sign for another 2 years. Look at what the customer is doing you have the data. Also older people do not want to speak to Tobi as Tobi did not help at all. I just spend 1 hour on the phone to try and get through to a person that could help me. So now I am not sure if I got the right subscription as I got 2 conflicting sales pitches.
