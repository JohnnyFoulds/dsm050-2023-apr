How on earth can you send a bill 3 months later and then treat me as if I haven't paid for 3 months?????\nIf you think you can hound me for this, then think again. I suggest you find a different business process to 'chuck' me into.\nYou need to explain where the bills were for this amount that you 'collecting ' for the last 3 months! You never sent the bill now I must pay or be cut off????\nAnd don't lie about pro rata and don't give me the nonsense about payment plans. I've heard your standard responses 3 times now. How can I be in arrears when I never even got a bill to pay?????\nI will not be intimidated by your robot. And if you want to suspend the fibre go ahead. I am not paying it.
