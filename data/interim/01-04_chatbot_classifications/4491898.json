After speaking to the agent and deciding what plan would be best for me, I agreed to the renewal. What a surprise when I tried to buy airtime and I found out I could not top up my airtime. This was an important part of my requirements - a data plan that I could buy my own airtime for. I was then contacted by another agent after numerous attempts to sort this out. She advised that she would have to cancel the contract and start afresh from 1 July with the contract I thought I was getting. Today I got an sms stating contract updated but now instead of 20GB data I have 0GB! Even the 17.6GB data left over from June has gone! At least I could buy the airtime as promised! Then try and sort it out and the BOT cannot help but you can't speak to anyone human!
